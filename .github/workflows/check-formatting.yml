# GitHub action workflow that performs a source code formatting check.
#
# The workflow fails if one or more of the .hpp or .cpp files in the repository
# are not properly formatted according to the rules in the .clang-format file
# located in the root of the repository directory, using clang-format version 18.
# In that case, the log file provides a list of improperly formatted files.
# Source files with other extensions (including .h, .c, .hh, .cc) are NOT tested
# to allow for differently formatted third-party code.
