# GitHub action workflow that checks the build process on multiple platforms.
#
# The workflow builds the code (without MPI and without MakeUp)
# using GCC on Ubuntu and using Clang on macOS, in two different jobs.
# Other compiler/platform combinations can be added if the need arises.
# The workflow fails if there are any build errors and/or warnings.
