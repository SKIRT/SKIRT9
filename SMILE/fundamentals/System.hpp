/** The System class provides a set of functions that interact with the operating system or with
    the file system, often in a platform-dependent manner. One important function of the class is
    translating internal UTF-8 encoded strings to and from the encoding expected by the host
    system.

    A single instance of the System class must be constructed just after program startup, and
    certainly before any parallel threads are started. A good place is the first line of the main()
    function. The program should not use the exit() or abort() functions, but rather let the main()
    function run to normal completion and return an exit code. Except for the constructor and
    destructor, all public functions in this class are static and thread-safe. */

        C++ locales to the portable "classic C" locale, and initializes the console for reading and
        writing. This function is \em not thread-safe; it should be invoked exactly once at program
