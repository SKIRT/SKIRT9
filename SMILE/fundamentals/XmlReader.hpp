/** The XmlReader class implements a parser for the subset of XML that is sufficient to represent
    SMILE schemas and datasets. Specifically, the input stream must be a well-formed XML 1.0
    document with the following additional limitations and caveats.

    - The text must be UTF-8 encoded (upwards compatible with 7-bit ASCII). Byte sequences that
      are not valid UTF-8 result in an error.
    - The presence of a document type definition (DTD) is not supported and results in an error.
    - Only (nested) elements and element attributes are supported. Comments and processing
      instructions (including the XML prolog declaration on the first line) are ignored.
      CDATA sections or text other than white space between elements result in an error.
    - Element and attribute names must start with a 7-bit ASCII letter [a-zA-Z] and can further
      contain letters [a-zA-Z], digits [0-9], and dashes (-). Any other characters are prohibited
      and will result in an error (note that this is a lot more restrictive than standard XML).
    - There is no support for namespaces; a colon in a name results in an error (per the above).
    - Attribute value strings may be surrounded by single or double quotes. To allow attribute
      values to contain both single and double quotes, the single-quote character (') may be
      represented as "&apos;", and the double-quote character (") as "\&quot;".
    - The ampersand character (\&) and the angle brackets (<,>) in attribute values should be
      represented as "&amp;", "&lt;", and "&gt;" respectively. Other than these, entity
      and character references (starting with an \&) are not supported and result in an error.
    - Newline characters are not allowed in attribute values, and a tab is interpreted as a space.

    When an error occurs while opening or parsing the XML data stream, the constructor and methods
    of this class throw a FatalError with an appropriate error message.
