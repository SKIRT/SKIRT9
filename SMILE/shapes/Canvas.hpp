/** The Canvas class represents a simple pixelated canvas with support for drawing RGB-colored
    lines and saving to a TIFF file for viewing. The canvas is always square with a logical
    coordinate range between 0 and 1 in each direction. The number of pixels must be specified at
    construction and is the same in each direction. Colors are specified as three RGB components
    ranging from 0 (no intensity) to 1 (maximum intensity). Line widths are specified in units
    where the canvas size equals 1. The canvas is initialized with a black background (i.e. all
    pixels values are set to zero), and with a default line color of white (i.e. the three
    components equal 1) and a default line width of 0.01 (i.e. 1/100 of the canvas size). */

        expanding the mathematical line between the given points with half of the current width in
