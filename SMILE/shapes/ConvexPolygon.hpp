/** The ConvexPolygon class represents a planar convex polygon, and provides support for extracting
    specific properties such as the bottom-most and top-most points. There is a (fairly small)
    compile-time limit on the number of points to avoid memory allocation on the heap. The user
    should ensure that at least 3 and at most \em maxPoints points are added to the polygon,
    that they are added in consecutive clockwise order, that there is a nontrivial distance between
    all points, and that the resulting polygon is convex. If these restrictions are violated, the
    behavior of some of the functions in this class is undefined. */
