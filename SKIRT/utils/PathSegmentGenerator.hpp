/** PathSegmentGenerator is the abstract base class for classes that calculate and return the
    segments of a path through a spatial grid segment by segment. This base class offers the public
    interface for obtaining the segments one by one after initializing the path with a given
    starting position and direction. A subclass must be provided for each type of spatial grid.
    Usually, this subclass is implemented as a private class inside the corresponding SpatialGrid
    subclass.

    In addition to the public interface, the PathSegmentGenerator class also offers facilities for
    use by subclasses. These include functions to access the position and direction of the path, to
    set the cell index and path length for the next segment, and to help track the state of the
    generator. */
