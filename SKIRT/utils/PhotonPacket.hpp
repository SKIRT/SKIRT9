/** The PhotonPacket class is used to describe monochromatic photon packets, the basic entities
    that are transported during a radiative transfer simulation. The fundamental properties of a
    photon packet include its \em wavelength and its \em weight. The wavelength property specifies
    the wavelength (or equivalenty, the frequency) of all photons in the packet. The weight
    property specifies the number of photons carried by the packet, or more precisely the number of
    photons per unit of time. Indeed, because we consider time-independent models, a photon packet
    actually represents a photon stream, consisting of a number of photons per unit of time. The
    weight can be fractional because it is derived from some arbitrary luminosity, and because it
    can be adjusted by arbitrary biasing factors during the photon packet's lifetime.

    Note that adjusting a photon packet's wavelength (perhaps because of a Doppler shift)
    indirectly affects the luminosity represented by the packet, because the latter is directly
    proportional to the frequency and thus inversely proportional to the wavelength.

    Apart from its wavelength and weight, a photon packet carries information about its polarization
    state, about its origin (e.g. emission by a primary or secondary source), about the
    interactions it experienced since its emission (e.g. the number of scattering events), and
    about its current path (e.g. starting position, propagation direction, spatial grid cells being
    crossed). A photon packet also carries a unique identifier (within the current emission
    segment) for the \em history it is part of, i.e. the collection of scattered and peeled-off
    packets derived from the same originally launched packet (emitted by a primary or secondary
    source). This history index can be used by instruments to group the fluxes of all photon
    packets belonging to the same history.

    Implementation notes
    --------------------

    For a given luminosity \f$L\f$ (representing the amount of energy carried by the photon packet
    per unit of time) and wavelength \f$\lambda=c/\nu\f$, the weight of the photon packet (i.e. the
    number of photons it carries per unit time) can be written as \f[ W = \frac{L}{h\nu} =
    \frac{L\lambda}{hc}. \f] To avoid multiplying and dividing by the constant factor \f$hc\f$,
    the weight tracked by a photon packet is instead simply defined as \f$W'=L\lambda\f$.

    The current path and the polarization state are handled by publicly inheriting repectively the
    SpatialGridPath class and the StokesVector class. For performance reasons, a PhotonPacket object
    is usually constructed once at the start of a loop and then reused in the loop body for many
    consecutive launches; this allows the vectors with path information to remain allocated. Also,
    several trivial functions are implemented inline in the header.

    The PhotonPacket class offers auxiliary facilities for caching "technical" information related
    to a photon packet's state during its lifecycle. This optional information is managed by the
    clients invoking the corresponding store and retrieve functions. Examples include the observed
    optical depth, used to avoid recalculating the optical depth for consecutive instruments with
    the same viewing direction, and extra scattering information, used by some material mixes to
    ensure that peel-off and random-walk operations for a given scattering interaction are treated
    consistently. */
