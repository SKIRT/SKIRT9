/** An object of the Direction class represents a direction in three-dimensional space. In
    principle only two coordinates are necessary to fully characterize a direction; a possible
    choice is spherical coordinates on the unit sphere. However in this class, a direction is
    internally represented by means of its three cartesian coordinates \f$(k_x,k_y,k_z)\f$. These
    coordinates must satisfy the normalization relation \f[ k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2=1. \f]

    To assist client code using the Direction class with ensuring this normalization, the
    constructors and the set() functions offer the Boolean \em normalize argument. If set to true,
    the constructor or function will automatically normalize the components passed by the caller.
    If set to false, the components are copied as given without any further verification. This can
    be used to avoid redundant calculations in case the caller has already ensured normalization.

    An important exception to the normalization invariant occurs when all three direction
    components are zero, resulting in an invalid "null" direction. This can happen, for example,
    when constructing a direction from user input or from the cross product of two parallel
    vectors. In situations where a null direction may occur, client code should test for this using
    the Vec::isNull() function.

    The Direction class is publicly based on the Vec class, and the direction coordinates
    \f$(k_x,k_y,k_z)\f$ are stored in the Vec components \em x, \em y and \em z. Consequently the
    functions and operators defined for Vec are automatically available for Direction, except for
    functions that would break the normalization (e.g. the compound-assignment operators). */
