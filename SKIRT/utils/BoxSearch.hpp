/** BoxSearch is a helper class for organizing spatial objects in a data structure that allows
    efficient retrieval of all objects that overlap a given point or ray. The class actually works
    with the bounding boxes of the objects being held, and leaves more detailed tests for
    containment or intersection to the client code.

    The spatial objects held by a BoxSearch instance are called entities. They are identified by
    a unique index \f$m\f$ ranging from 0 to \f$M-1\f$, where \f$M\f$ is the number of managed
    entities.

        prevously are removed and replaced by the new ones.

        The \em bounds callback function returns the bounding box of the entity with the given
        index. The \em intersects callback function returns true if the entity with the given index
        possibly intersects the specified box, and false otherwise. A relaxed intersection test
        such as testing against the bounding box is allowed but a stricter intersection test will
        result in more efficient retrieval queries.

        The callback functions are invoked one or more times for indices \f$m\f$ ranging from 0 to
        \f$M-1\f$, in arbitrary order. For given values of their argument(s), the callback
        functions must always return the same value. */
