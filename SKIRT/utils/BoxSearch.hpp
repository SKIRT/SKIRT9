/** BoxSearch is a utility class for organizing spatial objects in a data structure that allows
    efficient retrieval of all objects that overlap a given point or ray. The class actually works
    with the bounding boxes of the objects being held, and leaves more detailed tests for
    containment or intersection to the client code.

    The spatial objects held by a BoxSearch instance are called entities. They are identified by a
    unique index \f$m\f$ ranging from 0 to \f$M-1\f$, where \f$M\f$ is the number of managed
    entities. All entities are handed to the BoxSearch instance in one go, so that they can be
    "bulk-loaded" into the search structure.

    The current implementation proceeds as follows. First, a regular Cartesian grid is contructed
    that partitions 3D space into \f$N_b^3\f$ blocks, where \f$N_b\f$ depends on the number of
    entities with a floor of \f$N_b=20\f$ up to 1 million entities. Each block is then assigned a
    list of indices for all entities that possibly intersect with the block. In an attempt to
    balance the list lengths, the block separation points in each coordinate direction are chosen
    so that the entity bounding box centers are approximately evently distributed over the blocks
    in that direction. Locating the block containing a given query position then boils down to
    three binary searches (one in each direction).

    For performance reasons, the query functions use a template argument type instead of the
    appropriate std::function<> type declaration, which means they must be implemented inline in
    this header. */

        prevously are removed and replaced by the new ones.

        The \em bounds callback function returns the bounding box of the entity with the given
        index. The \em intersects callback function returns true if the entity with the given index
        possibly intersects the specified box, and false otherwise. A relaxed intersection test
        such as testing against the bounding box is allowed but a stricter intersection test will
        result in more efficient retrieval queries.

        The callback functions are invoked one or more times for indices \f$m\f$ ranging from 0 to
