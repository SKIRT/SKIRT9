/** A SpatialGridPath object contains the geometric details of a path through a spatial grid. Given
    a spatial grid, i.e. some partition of space into cells, a starting position \f${\bf{r}}\f$ and
    a propagation direction \f${\bf{k}}\f$, one can calculate the path through the grid. A
    SpatialGridPath object maintains a record for each cell crossed by the path, called a \em
    segment. A segment stores the spatial cell index (so the cell can be identified in the grid),
    together with the physical path length \f$\Delta s\f$ covered within the cell, and the path
    length \f$s\f$ covered along the entire path up to the end of the cell.

    In addition, a SpatialGridPath object allows storing a (cumulative) optical depth \f$tau\f$
    with each path segment. Before this non-geometric information is used, it must be set
    explicitly by a client class after the segments of the path have been calculated. As a
    convenience to client classes, the SpatialGridPath class offers some operations on this extra
    information, such as locating the interaction point along the path corresponding to a given
    optical depth.

    Updating the initial position and/or the direction of the path invalidates all segments in the
    path, but the segments are not automatically cleared. One should call the clear() function or
    the moveInside() function to do so. */
