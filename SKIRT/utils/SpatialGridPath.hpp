/** A SpatialGridPath object contains the geometric details of a path through a spatial grid. Given
    a spatial grid, i.e. some partition of space into cells, a starting position \f${\bf{r}}\f$ and
    a propagation direction \f${\bf{k}}\f$, one can calculate the path through the grid. A
    SpatialGridPath object maintains a record for each cell crossed by the path, called a \em
    segment. A segment stores the spatial cell index (so the cell can be identified in the grid),
    together with the physical path length \f$\Delta s\f$ covered within the cell, and the path
    length \f$s\f$ covered along the entire path up to the end of the cell.

    Updating the initial position and/or the direction of the path invalidates all segments in the
    path, but the segments are not automatically cleared. One should call the clear() function or
    the moveInside() function to do so.

    In addition to the geometric data, a SpatialGridPath object allows client code to store optical
    depth information with each path segment, as well as information on the interaction point along
    the path corresponding to a given optical depth. Specifically, each path segment can store
    either an extinction optical depth (for forced-scattering photon life cycles \em without
    explicit absorption) or both a scattering and absorption optical depth (for forced-scattering
    photon life cycles \em with explicit absorption). The interaction point information includes
    the spatial cell index, the cumulative distance, and the cumulative absorption optical depth
    (for the second type of photon cycle). */
