/** The CarbonMonoxideGasMix class describes the material properties related to selected rotational
    and rovibrational transitions in carbon monoxide (CO).

    The energy levels of CO are discretized into vibrational levels (quantum number \f$v\f$) and
    more subdivided rotational levels (quantum number \f$J\f$). The vibrational levels are
    quantized by the magnitude of the dipole moment, and the rotational levels are quantized by the
    magnitude of the dipole rotation. This class supports transitions involving vibrational levels
    \f$v=0\f$ and \f$v=1\f$ and rotational levels up to \f$J=20\f$. The selection rules allow two
    types of transitions between these energy levels. Rotational transitions change the rotational
    energy level by \f$\Delta J=\pm 1\f$. The corresponding lines are in the far-infrared to
    millimeter wavelength range, up to about 2600 \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$. Rovibrational transitions
    change both the rotational and vibrational levels at the same time (\f$\Delta J=\pm1\f$ and
    \f$v=0-1\f$). The corresponding lines, at least for the two supported vibrational levels, are
    all in the near infrared around 4.7 \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$.

    For each supported transition, the emission luminosity and self-absorption opacity in a given
    cell are determined from gas properties defined in the input model (CO number density,
    molecular hydrogen number density, kinetic gas temperature) and the local radiation field
    calculated by the simulation taking into account dust extinction. The class performs an
    iterative, non-LTE calculation including the effects of collisional transitions (excitation and
    de-excitation with molecular hydrogen as interaction partner) and photonic transitions
    (spontaneous emission, absorption, and induced emission). This allows establishing the energy
    level distribution (population) for a wide range of material densities and radiation fields.

    <b>Configuring the simulation</b>

    Simulations of the CO transition spectra should include primary sources and a dust medium in
    addition to a medium component configured with the carbon monoxide mix (this class).
    Furthermore, the \em simulationMode should be set to "DustAndGasEmission" and \em
    iterateSecondaryEmission should be enabled. The radiation field wavelength grid should properly
    resolve the UV, optical, and infrared wavelength range (relevant for dust emission) and the
    wavelength ranges of the supported CO transition lines.

    Separate instruments can be configured for the relevant wavelength ranges, e.g. using a
    logarithmic grid for the continuum spectrum and linear grids for the line profiles.

    During primary emission, the simulation determines the radiation field resulting from the
    primary sources and dust attenuation (CO line absorption is taken to be zero at this stage).
    The resulting radiation field allows a first estimation of the CO level populations for each
    spatial grid cell; this calculation happens in the updateSpecificState() function, which is
    invoked at the end of primary emission.

    During secondary emission, the simulation takes into account emission from all configured media
    (dust continuum and CO lines) in addition to absorption by these same media (dust and CO). For
    CO, the previously stored level populations allow calculating the line emission spectrum and
    the line self-absorption cross sections. This results in an updated radiation field, which will
    in turn influence the CO level populations (and for high optical depths, possibly the dust
    temperature), which in turn influences the secondary emission spectra. In order to obtain a
    self-consistent result, the simulation must therefore iterate over secondary emission.

    As indicated above, the input model must provide values for the spatial distribution of three
    medium properties: CO number density, molecular hydrogen number density, and kinetic gas
    temperature. These values remain constant during the simulation. Most often, this information
    will be read from an input file by associating the CO material mix with a subclass of
    ImportedMedium. For that medium component, the ski file attribute \em importTemperature
    <b>must</b> be set to 'true', and \em importMetallicity and \em importVariableMixParams must be
    left at 'false'. The additional column required by the CO material mix (molecular hydrogen
    number density) is automatically imported and is expected <b>after</b> all other columns. For
    example, if bulk velocities are also imported for this medium component (i.e. \em
    importVelocity is 'true'), the column order would be \f[ ..., n_\mathrm{CO}, T_\mathrm{kin},
    v_\mathrm{x}, v_\mathrm{y}, v_\mathrm{z}, n_\mathrm{H2} \f]

    For basic testing purposes, the CO material mix can also be associated with a geometric medium
    component. The geometry then defines the spatial density distribution (i.e.
    \f$n_\mathrm{CO}\f$), and the material mix offers configuration properties to specify a fixed
    default value for the gas temperature and for the number of hydrogen molecules per CO molecule
    that will be used across the spatial domain. In this case, the molecular hydrogen number
    density is thus implicitly defined based on the CO number density by a constant multiplier.

    <b>Level populations</b>

    The level populations \f$n_i\f$ (used later to calculate the emission luminosities and the
    absorption opacities) are obtained by solving the statistical equilibrium equations. The
    equation for the energy level with index \f$i\f$ (where indices increase from lowest to highest
    energy state) is given by

    \f[ \sum^{N_\mathrm{lp}}_{j>i} n_jA_{ji} + \sum^{N_\mathrm{lp}}_{j\neq i} \Big[ (n_jB_{ji} -
    n_iB_{ij})J_\lambda(\lambda_{ij})\Big] + \sum^{N_\mathrm{lp}}_{j\neq i}
    \big[n_jC_{ji}(n_\mathrm{H2} ,T_\mathrm{kin}) - n_iC_{ij}(n_\mathrm{H2},T_\mathrm{kin})\big]=0,
    \f]

    where \f$\lambda_{ij}\f$ is the transition wavelength and \f$A_{ij}\f$, \f$B_{ij}\f$,
    \f$B_{ji}\f$ are the Einstein coefficients for spontaneous emission, induced emission, and
    absorption, and \f$C_{ij}\f$, \f$C_{ji}\f$ the coefficients for collisional excitation and
    de-excitation. These coefficients are taken from the literature (references to be provided).

    \em Note

    We assume that the level populations of all molecules in a given spatial cell are the same, and
    to calculate them we use the mean intensity of the radiation field at the rest wavelength of
    each transition. This means that the radiation field wavelength grid needs just a single bin
    for each transition. We consider this assumption to be valid if the width of the velocity bin
    (or wavelength bin) of the observed spectrum is larger than the velocity dispersion of each
    cell. In reality, however, the molecules in a cell have a velocity dispersion and the perceived
    transition wavelength is different for each molecule. Therefore, one should calculate the mean
    intensities of each level transition at several velocity bins in the wavelength range
    corresponding to the velocity dispersion. However, the computational cost becomes very large.

    <b>Emission</b>

    The integrated line luminosity \f$L_\ell\f$ corresponding to the transition with index
    \f$\ell\f$ for a given spatial cell is given by

    \f[ L_\ell = \frac{hc}{\lambda_\ell} A_{ul} n_u V_\mathrm{cell}, \f]

    where \f$\lambda_\ell\f$ is the transition wavelength, \f$u\f$ and \f$l\f$ are the indices of
    the energy levels before and after the corresponding transition, and \f$V_\mathrm{cell}\f$ is
    the volume of the cell. The SKIRT framework automatically adds a Gaussian line profile assuming
    a thermal velocity corresponding to the kinetic temperature in the cell and the mass of a CO
    molecule, in addition to any Doppler shifts caused by the bulk velocity in the cell.

    <b>Absorption</b>

    During primary emission, absorption cannot be calculated (and is taken to be zero) because the
    level populations have not yet been established. During secondary emission, the absorption
    opacity \f$k^\text{abs}(\lambda)\f$ as a function of wavelength \f$\lambda\f$ is given by

    \f[ k^\text{abs}(\lambda) = \sum_\ell \, \frac{h c}{4\pi \lambda_\ell}(n_l\,B_{lu}-n_u\,B_{ul})
    \,\phi_\ell(\lambda) \f]

    where the sum with index \f$\ell\f$ runs over all supported lines, \f$u\f$ and \f$l\f$ are the
    indices of the energy levels before and after the corresponding transition, and
    \f$\phi_\ell(\lambda)\f$ is the Gaussian profile of line \f$\ell\f$.

    The calculation explicitly includes the Gaussian line profile caused by thermal motion of the
    molecules in the local bulk velocity frame of the cell. Moreover, the absorption profiles of
    all supported lines are superposed on top of each other. In practice, the implementation
    attempts to calculate just the terms that have a significant contribution at any given
    wavelength.
