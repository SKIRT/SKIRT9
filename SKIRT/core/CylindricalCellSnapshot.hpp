/** A CylindricalCellSnapshot object represents the data in a snapshot imported from a column text
    file and discretized using a cylindrical coordinate-grid.

    Each line in the text file represents a cylindrical cell lined up with the cylindrical
    coordinate axes. The columns specify the coordinates of the bordering planes and cylinders (see
    the CylCell class documentation for more information) along with properties such as the density
    in the cell.

    The intention is for the cells to define a partition of the spatial domain, and usually they
    will, however this is not enforced. When two or more cells overlap at a given position, the
    properties for that position will be taken from the cell that is listed first in the imported
    file. When no cells overlap a given position, the density at that position is considered to be
    zero. To avoid thin slices of zero density between cells, the coordinates for common walls or
    corners in neighboring cells should be identical.

    This class is based on the Snapshot class; it uses the facilities offered there to configure
    and read the snapshot data, and it implements all functions in the general Snapshot public
    interface. If the snapshot configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a
    given spatial position, an effort is made to accelerate the search for the cell containing that
    position even for a large number of cells. */

    /** This function reads the snapshot data from the input file, honoring the options set through
        the configuration functions, stores the data for later use, and closes the file by calling
        the base class Snapshot::close() function.

        Cells with an associated temperature above the cutoff temperature (if one has been
        configured) are assigned a density value of zero, so that they have zero mass regardless of
        the imported mass/density properties. Note that we cannot simply ignore these cells because
        an empty cell may overlap and thus hide (a portion of) a nonempty cell later in the list.

        The function also logs some statistical information about the import. If the snapshot
        configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a given spatial position,
        this function builds a data structure that accelerates the search for the appropriate cell.
