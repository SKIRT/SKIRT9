/** A CylindricalCellSnapshot object represents the data in a 2D or 3D snapshot imported from a
    column text file and discretized using cylindrical coordinates.

    <em>3D data</em>

    By default, each line in the text file represents a 3D cylindrical cell lined up with the
    cylindrical coordinate axes. The columns specify the coordinates of the bordering planes and
    cylinders, along with properties such as density. Specifically, each cell is bordered by:

    - two vertical cylinders centered on the origin defined by radii \f$0 \le R_\text{min} \le
    R_\text{max}\f$,

    - two meridional half-planes (with \f$R>0\f$) defined by azimuth angles \f$-\pi \le
    \varphi_\text{min} \le \varphi_\text{max} \le \pi\f$ with \f$\varphi_\text{max} -
    \varphi_\text{min} \le \pi\f$,

    - two horizontal planes defined by \f$z_\text{min} \le z_\text{max}\f$.

    \note Because of the limitations on the range of \f$\varphi\f$, a Cylcell cannot straddle the
    negative x-axis of the Cartesian model coordinate system, and it cannot span more than half of
    the azimuth circle.

    The intention is for the cells to define a partition of the spatial domain, and usually they
    will, however this is not enforced. When two or more cells overlap at a given position, the
    properties for that position will be taken from the cell that is listed first in the imported
    file. When no cells overlap a given position, the density at that position is considered to be
    zero. To avoid thin slices of zero density between cells, the coordinates for common walls or
    corners in neighboring cells should be identical.

    <em>Velocities</em>

    If velocity or magnetic field vectors are being imported, the class converts these from
    cylindrical to Cartesian coordinates using \f[\begin{aligned} v_\text{x} &= v_{R}\cos\varphi -
    v_\varphi\sin\varphi \\ v_\text{y} &= v_{R}\sin\varphi + v_\varphi\cos\varphi \\ v_\text{z} &=
    v_\text{z} \end{aligned}\f] where \f$\varphi = (\varphi_\text{min}+\varphi_\text{max})/2\f$ is
    the central angle of the corresponding cell.

    <em>2D data</em>

    If the auto-revolve feature is enabled, each line in the text file represents a 2D cell in the
    meridional plane with \f$\varphi=0\f$. The cells are defined using just the radial and vertical
    borders \f$0 \le R_\text{min} \le R_\text{max}\f$ and \f$z_\text{min} \le z_\text{max}\f$.
    After reading the text file, these 2D cells will automatically be revolved around the z-axis
    using a user-specified number of \f$\varphi\f$ bins.

    To enable the auto-revolve feature, the number of auto-revolve bins must be set to at least 2.
    Also, all \f$\varphi_\text{min}\f$ and \f$\varphi_\text{max}\f$ values in the input file must
    be exactly zero. A nonzero value in these columns will trigger a fatal error.

    \note It is \em not allowed to omit the \f$\varphi_\text{min}, \varphi_\text{max}\f$ columns.

    If the 2D input file specifies an integrated mass type (as opposed to a mass density), the mass
    of a 2D cell is evenly distributed over the revolved 3D bins.

    For a model that includes velocities, the velocities will be converted from cylindrical to
    Cartesian coordinates as described above after revolving to a 3D representation. Because the
    result of this conversion depends on the azimuth angle, the user must set a sufficiently high
    number of auto-revolve bins to properly resolve the revolved velocity field.

    <em>Implementation</em>

    This class is based on the Snapshot class; it uses the facilities offered there to configure
    and read the snapshot data, and it implements all functions in the general Snapshot public
    interface. If the snapshot configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a
    given spatial position, an effort is made to accelerate the search for the cell containing that
    position even for a large number of cells. */

    //================= Construction - Destruction =================

public:
    /** This function sets the number of auto-revolve azimuth bins, enabling the auto-revolve
        feature if the number of bins is at least 2 and all azimuth angles in the imported data are
        zero (see the class header for more information). */
    void setNumAutoRevolveBins(int numBins);

    //========== Reading ==========

public:
    /** This function reads the snapshot data from the input file, honoring the options set through
        the configuration functions, stores the data for later use, and closes the file by calling
        the base class Snapshot::close() function.

        Cells with an associated temperature above the cutoff temperature (if one has been
        configured) are assigned a density value of zero, so that they have zero mass regardless of
        the imported mass/density properties. Note that we cannot simply ignore these cells because
        an empty cell may overlap and thus hide (a portion of) a nonempty cell later in the list.

        If velocity and/or magnetic field vectors are being imported, the function converts these
        from cylindrical to Cartesian coordinates as described in the class header.

        The function also logs some statistical information about the import. If the snapshot
        configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a given spatial position,
        this function builds a data structure that accelerates the search for the appropriate cell.
