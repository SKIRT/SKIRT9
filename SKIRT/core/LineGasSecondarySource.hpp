        abstract EmittingGasMix class. Before the constructor returns, the newly created object is

        automatically be deleted). */

        spatial cell of the simulation, and returns the total bolometric luminosity. */

    /** This function prepares the mapping of history indices to spatial cells, given the range of
        history indices allocated to this source. */
    void preparePacketMap(size_t firstIndex, size_t numIndices) override;

    /** This function causes the photon packet \em pp to be launched from one of the cells in the
        spatial grid using the given history index. Because photon packets launched from a given
        spatial cell are usually handled consecutively by the same execution thread, this function
        can and does calculate the line luminosities for a given cell only once. It preserves the
        relevant information from one invocation of the function to the next in a helper object
        allocated with thread-local storage scope. As a result, memory requirements are limited to
        storing the information for only a single cell per execution thread, and the calculation is
        still performed only once per cell.

        Once the line luminosities for the current cell are known, the function randomly selects
        one of the central line wavelengths from the discrete distribution represented by the line
        luminosities and/or from a uniform distribution as governed by the configured wavelength
        bias fraction (the configured bias wavelength distribution is ignored), adjusting the
        launch weight appropriately.

        The selected central line wavelength is adjusted with a random Doppler shift corresponding
        to the thermal motion of the particle emitting that line. The particle velocity is drawn
        from a Maxwell-Boltzman distribution parametrized by the temperature of the medium in the
        emitting cell (obtained from the medium state) and the mass of the emitting particle
        (obtained from the emitting material mix). If the temperature is zero or unavailable, or if
        the particle mass is zero, no thermal Doppler shift is added. The function further obtains
        the bulk velocity of the cell and applies the corresponding macroscopic Doppler shift.
        Other than this, the emission is assumed to be unpolarized and isotropic in the comoving
        frame.

        The function then generates a random position uniformly within the spatial cell.

        Finally, the function actually initializes the photon packet with this information. */
