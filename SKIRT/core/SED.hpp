/** An instance of a SED subclass represents a spectral energy distribution \f$L_\lambda\f$, i.e.
    power per unit of wavelength. This abstract base class just defines an interface that must be
    implemented by each subclass. There are three key operations: drawing a random wavelength from
    the spectral energy distribution, calculating the specific luminosity at a given wavelength,
    and calculating the integrated luminosity over a given wavelength range.

    The spectral energy distribution is automatically normalized to unity over the source
    wavelength range intersected with the intrinsic wavelength range of the distribution.
    Consequently, the random wavelengths returned by the generateWavelength() function will always
    fall inside that range.

    The functions calculating specific or integrated luminosities use just the intrinsic wavelength
    range of the distribution (i.e. they are not limited by the source range). However, for
    consistency, they use the same normalization as the generateWavelength() function. This
    approach makes it possible for a user to configure a luminosity normalization at a wavelength
    (or over a wavelength range) outside of the wavelength range where the source is actually
    emitting. */
