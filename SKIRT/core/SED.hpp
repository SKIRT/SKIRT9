/** An instance of a SED subclass represents a spectral energy distribution \f$L_\lambda\f$, i.e.
    power per unit of wavelength. This abstract base class just defines an interface that must be
    implemented by each subclass. The two key operations supported by all SEDs are drawing a random
    wavelength from the spectral energy distribution and calculating the integrated luminosity over
    a given wavelength range.

    There are two important categories of emission spectra, each represented by an abstract SED
    subclass:

    - ContSED: regular continuous spectra. These SEDs allow obtaining the specific luminosity at a
    given wavelength or for a sampled range of wavelengths. They support all operations of the code
    to the fullest degree possible.

    - LineSED: line emission spectra, consisting of one or more discrete emission lines with zero
    width. Mathematically, the specific luminosity is infinite at the line wavelengths and zero
    everywhere else, while the integrated luminosity over one or more lines is finite. In practice,
    the specific luminosity is numerically undefined, imposing important restrictions. For example,
    luminosity normalization must use integration over a wavelength range and the mechanism for
    wavelength biasing does not work.

    Each SED subclass, regardless of its category, must ensure that the implemented spectral energy
    distribution is normalized to unity over the normalization wavelength range, which is defined
    as the intersection of the source wavelength range (determined by the SourceSystem) and the
    intrinsic wavelength range of the implemented distribution (determined by the SED subclass). A
    convenience function offered by this abstract base class returns this normalization wavelength
    range.

    Specifically, this means that the random wavelengths returned by the generateWavelength()
    function will always fall inside the normalization range. On the other hand, while the
    functions calculating specific and integrated luminosities use the same normalization, they
    operate across the full intrinsic wavelength range of the %SED without being limited by the
    source wavelength range. This makes it possible for a user to configure a luminosity
    normalization at a wavelength (or over a wavelength range) outside of the wavelength range
    where the sources are actually emitting. */
