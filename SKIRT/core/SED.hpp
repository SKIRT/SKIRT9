/** An instance of a SED subclass represents a spectral energy distribution \f$L_\lambda\f$, i.e.
    power per unit of wavelength. This abstract base class just defines an interface that must be
    implemented by each subclass. There are three key operations: drawing a random wavelength from
    the spectral energy distribution, calculating the specific luminosity at a given wavelength,
    and calculating the integrated luminosity over a given wavelength range.

    Each SED subclass must ensure that the implemented spectral energy distribution is normalized
    to unity over the normalization wavelength range, which is defined as the intersection of the
    source wavelength range (determined by the SourceSystem) and the intrinsic wavelength range of
    the implemented distribution (determined by the SED subclass). A convenience function offered
    by this abstract base class returns this normalization wavelength range.

    Specifically, this means that the random wavelengths returned by the generateWavelength()
    function will always fall inside the normalization range. On the other hand, while the
    functions calculating specific and integrated luminosities use the same normalization, they
    operate across the full intrinsic wavelength range of the %SED without being limited by the
    source wavelength range. This makes it possible for a user to configure a luminosity
    normalization at a wavelength (or over a wavelength range) outside of the wavelength range
    where the sources are actually emitting. */
