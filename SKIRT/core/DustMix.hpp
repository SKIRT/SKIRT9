/** DustMix is the abstract base class for all classes representing the material properties of a
    dust medium. It implements the complete abstract interface defined by the MaterialMix base
    class for obtaining optical material properties. Depending on the scattering mode returned by
    the scatteringMode() function (which must be overridden by subclasses that support a scattering
    mode other than HenyeyGreenstein), the DustMix setup machinery requests the relevant optical
    dust properties from the subclass, and caches this information (possibly with some additional
    precalculated data) for later use. During the simulation, these properties can then be served
    up without further access to the subclass.

    In all cases, the properties served through the MaterialMix base class interface correspond to
    the properties of a single grain population that is representative for the complete dust mix.
    For dust mixes described by multiple grain populations, the optical properties should be
    integrated over the grain size distribution and accumulated across all grain populations. In
    the context of tracking photon paths through a dusty medium, using these integrated absorption
    and scattering cross sections and Mueller matrix coefficients is mathematically exact. In other
    words, for scattering modes MaterialPhaseFunction and SphericalPolarization, the representative
    grain approach does not involve an approximation. However, the calculation of a representative
    scattering asymmetry parameter \f$g\f$ for use with the Henyey-Greenstein scattering mode does
    involve a non-exact averaging procedure. Because the Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase
    function is non-physical to begin with, using a single approximate \f$g\f$ value for the
    complete dust mix is usually considered to be acceptable. For more information on the
    calculation of representative grain properties in SKIRT, refer to the description of the
    MultiGrainDustMix class.

    The representative grain properties offered by this class are insufficient to accurately
    calculate dust emission spectra for the dust mixture. This is so because the emission spectrum
    is a nonlinear function of (among many other things) the grain size, and thus a single grain
    cannot accurately represent a population with a (potentialy large) range of grain sizes. Again,
    refer to the description of the MultiGrainDustMix class for more information.

    The implementation of polarization by scattering in this class is based on the analysis
    presented by Peest at al. 2017 (A&A, 601, A92).

    <b>Extreme forward (or backward) Henyey-Greenstein scattering</b>

    In the X-ray wavelength range, dust grains exhibit extreme forward scattering with asymmetry
    parameter \f$g\f$ values very close to unity. Calculating the value of and sampling from the
    Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase function becomes numerically unstable for \f$|g| > 1-10^{-6}\f$.
    Therefore, the implementation clips any larger \f$|g|\f$ values to that limit.

    More annoyingly, the bias weights for scattering peel-off photon packets can become very large,
    causing unacceptably high noise levels in the fluxes recorded by instruments. Consider the HG
    phase function, \f[ \Phi_\mathrm{HG}(\cos\theta) = \frac{1-g^2}{(1+g^2-2g\cos\theta)^{3/2}}.
    \f] Given the angle \f$\theta\f$ between the direction of the incoming photon packet and a
    given SKIRT instrument, the bias weight for a peel-off photon packet sent to the instrument is
    given by \f$w=\Phi_\mathrm{HG}(\cos\theta)\f$. For \f$g>0\f$, the largest bias weights are
    associated with peel-off photon packets emitted in the original propagation direction
    (\f$\theta=0\f$). Experiments show that the weigths should be kept under \f$\approx 10^3\f$ to
    achieve acceptable noise levels with a practical number of photon packets. Incidentally, for
    \f$g = 0.95\f$ we find \f$w\approx 780\f$, indicating the maximum asymmetry parameter value we
    could support given this criterion. For \f$g = 1-10^{-6}\f$, we find \f$w\approx 2 \times
    10^{12}\f$.

    To address this situation, we average the peel-off bias weight for a photon packet sent to an
    instrument over a portion of the phase function, as opposed to taking the value at a given
    angle. This introduces a certain amount of blur in recorded fluxes, while simultaneously
    decreasing the level of noise. The effect is reminiscent of that of an actual instrument's
    point spread function.

    We introduce the notation \f$\Psi(\alpha,\beta)\f$ for the definite integral of the HG phase
    function between two angles \f$0 \le \alpha \le \beta \le \pi\f$, and assuming \f$0 < |g| <
    1\f$, \f[ \Psi(\alpha,\beta) \equiv \int_{\cos\beta}^{\cos\alpha} \Phi_\mathrm{HG}(\cos\theta)
    \,\mathrm{d}\cos\theta = \frac{(1-g^2)}{g}\,\frac{(t_\beta-t_\alpha)}{t_\beta\,t_\alpha},\f]
    with \f[ t_x = \sqrt{1+g^2-2g\cos x}, \;\;x=\alpha,\beta. \f]

    We similarly use \f$\ell(\alpha,\beta)\f$ for the length of the interval between the cosines of
    two angles \f$0 \le \alpha \le \beta \le \pi\f$, \f[ \ell(\alpha,\beta) \equiv
    \cos\alpha-\cos\beta. \f]

    We further denote the half-opening angle of the instrument's solid angle as \f$\delta\f$, with
    \f$0 < \delta \ll \pi/2\f$. The averaged peel-off bias weight can then be written as, \f[
    \left<w\right> = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{\Psi(\theta-\delta,\theta+\delta)}
    {\ell(\theta-\delta,\theta+\delta)} & \mathrm{for}\; \delta \le \theta \le \pi-\delta, \\[15pt]
    \displaystyle \frac{\Psi(0,\delta-\theta) + \Psi(0,\delta+\theta)} {\ell(0,\delta-\theta) +
    \ell(0,\delta+\theta)} & \mathrm{for}\; \theta < \delta, \\[15pt] \displaystyle
    \frac{\Psi(\theta-\delta,\pi) + \Psi(2\pi-\theta-\delta,\pi)} {\ell(\theta-\delta,\pi) +
    \ell(2\pi-\theta-\delta,\pi)} & \mathrm{for}\; \theta > \pi-\delta. \end{cases} \f]

    The last two expressions are needed to handle the cases where the averaging interval straddles
    zero or \f$\pi\f$ because the definitions above are not valid for angles outside that range.

    Investigation of these expressions shows that a half-opening angle of \f$\delta = 4^\circ\f$
    dampens the maximum averaged bias weight for \em all \f$g\f$ to \f$\left<w\right>\approx
    820\f$. For \f$g = 0.999\f$, the maximum weight reaches \f$\left<w\right>\approx 810\f$ and
    remains saturated from there on. In conclusion, the implementation uses the regular bias weight
    for \f$|g| \le 0.95\f$ and the averaged bias weight for larger values, with \f$\delta =
    4^\circ\f$. As a result, recorded fluxes will be blurred accordingly. */

    /** This function obtains and/or precalculates information used to serve optical properties for
        the dust mix to the simulation.

        First, it obtains the optical properties of the dust mix from the subclass on a wavelength
        grid with a range spanning all wavelengths in the simulation, and with sufficient
        resolution so that no further interpolation is needed. This includes the absorption and
        scattering cross sections, the scattering asymmetry parameter, and/or the Mueller matrix
        coefficients as required by the implemented scattering mode.

        If the simulation wavelength range extends beyond 10 cm, it is cut off at that value and
        any dust cross sections beyond 10 cm are forced to zero. None of the currently provided
        dust mixes offers optical properties beyond 10 cm, and historically any values outside the
        supported range are clamped to the nearest available value. This leads to substantially
        overestimated dust extinction in the radio wavelength range. Hence this "hack".

        Furthermore, if the simulation tracks the radiation field, this function precalculates the
        Planck-integrated absorption cross sections on an appropriate temperature grid. This
        information is used to obtain the equilibrium temperature of the material mix (or rather,
        of its representative grain population) in a given embedding radiation field. */

    /** This function must be implemented in each subclass to obtain the representative grain
        optical properties for the dust mix. Although the function arguments provide for all
        properties that may be required, the list of actually required properties for a particular
        subclass depends on the scattering mode advertised by the scatteringMode() function.

        The first two arguments respectively specify the wavelength grid and (if applicable) the
        scattering angle grid on which the properties must be tabulated. The function must store
        the absorption and scattering cross sections and the asymmetry parameter into the three
        subsequent output arrays, and the Mueller coefficients into the four subsequent output
        tables (indexed on wavelength and angle in that order). These arrays and tables will
        already have the appropriate size (corresponding to the input wavelength grids) when the
        function gets called. Finally, the function must return the dust mass per hydrogen atom for
        the dust mix.

        For the HenyeyGreenstein scattering mode, the function must output the cross sections and
        the asymmetry parameter, and it must leave the Mueller coeficient tables untouched. For
        scattering modes other than HenyeyGreenstein, the asymmetry parameter output array may be
        filled with "relevant" values (not used for calculations but possibly exposed to the user
        through a Probe), or it may be left untouched. For the SphericalPolarization scattering
        mode, the function must fill all four Mueller coeficient tables. For the
        MaterialPhaseFunction scattering mode, the function must fill only the first table and it
        must leave the other tables untouched.

        For the SpheroidalPolarization mode, the function must also fill the sigmaabsvv and
        sigmaabspolvv tables. */

        For dust mixes, evaluation of the phase function depends on the scattering mode supported
        by supported by the dust mix, as defined by each subclass. For the most basic mode, the
        material mix provides a value for the scattering asymmetry parameter
        \f$g=\left<\cos\theta\right>\f$. A value of \f$g=0\f$ corresponds to isotropic scattering.
        Other values \f$-1\le g\le 1\f$ are substituted in the Henyey-Greenstein phase function,
        \f[ \Phi(\cos\theta) = \frac{1-g^2} {(1+g^2-2g\cos\theta)^{3/2}}. \f] For other scattering
        modes, the phase function provided by the material mix is invoked instead.

        In case polarization is supported in the current simulation configuration, the polarization
        state of the peel off photon packet is adjusted as well. The adjusted Stokes vector for a
        particular medium component is obtained as follows. The function rotates the Stokes vector
        from the reference direction in the previous scattering plane into the peel-off scattering
        plane, applies the Mueller matrix on the Stokes vector, and further rotates the Stokes
        vector from the reference direction in the peel-off scattering plane to the x-axis of the
        instrument to which the peel-off photon packet is headed. */

        For dust mixes, the operation depends on the scattering mode supported by the dust mix, as
        defined by each subclass. For the most basic mode, the dust mix provides a value for the
        scattering asymmetry parameter \f$g=\left<\cos\theta\right>\f$. For the value \f$g=0\f$,
        corresponding to isotropic scattering, a new direction is generated uniformly on the unit
        sphere. For other values \f$-1\le g\le 1\f$, a scattering angle \f$\theta\f$ is sampled
        from the Henyey-Greenstein phase function, \f[ \Phi(\cos\theta) =
        \frac{1-g^2}{(1+g^2-2g\cos\theta)^{3/2}}. \f] This can be accomplished as follows.
        Substituting \f$\mu=\cos\theta\f$, the probability distribution for \f$\mu\f$ (normalized
        to unity) becomes \f[ p(\mu)\,\text{d}\mu = \frac{1}{2} \,
        \frac{1-g^2}{(1+g^2-2g\mu)^{3/2}} \,\text{d}\mu \qquad -1\leq\mu\leq1 \f] We can use the
        transformation method to sample from this distribution. Given a uniform deviate
        \f$\mathcal{X}\f$, we need to solve \f[ {\mathcal{X}} = \int_{-1}^\mu p(\mu')\,\text{d}\mu'
        \f] Performing the integration and solving for \f$\mu\f$ yields \f[ \cos\theta = \mu =
        \frac{1+g^2-f^2}{2g} \quad\text{with}\quad f=\frac{1-g^2}{1-g+2g {\mathcal{X}}}
        \qquad\text{for}\; g\neq 0 \f] For other scattering modes, a function provided by the dust
        mix is invoked instead to obtain a random scattering direction for the photon packet.

        In case polarization is supported in the current simulation configuration, the polarization
        state of the photon packet is adjusted as well. Note that all media must either support
        polarization or not support it, mixing these support levels is not allowed. Compliance with
        this requirement is verified during setup of the simulation. The adjusted Stokes vector is
        obtained as follows, again using the randomly selected medium component. After obtaining
        the sampled scattering angles \f$\theta\f$ and \f$\phi\f$ from the material mix, the Stokes
        vector of the photon packet is rotated into the scattering plane and transformed by
        applying the Mueller matrix. Finally, the new direction is computed from the previously
        sampled \f$\theta\f$ and \f$\phi\f$ angles. */

        this distribution through numerical inversion, that is to say, by solving the equation
        \f[\label{eq:numInvTheta} {\cal{X}} =\frac{\int_0^\theta
        S_{11}\sin\theta'\,\text{d}\theta'}{\int_0^\pi S_{11}\sin\theta'\, \text{d}\theta'} \f] for
        \f$\theta\f$, where \f${\cal{X}}\f$ is a uniform deviate.

        Once we have selected a random scattering angle \f$\theta\f$, we sample a random azimuthal
        angle \f$\phi\f$ from the normalized conditional distribution, \f[ \Phi_\theta(\phi)
        =\frac{\Phi(\theta,\phi)}{\int_0^{2\pi} \Phi(\theta,\phi')\,\text{d}\phi'}
        =\frac{1}{2\pi}\left(1+ P_{\text{L}}\,\frac{S_{12}}{S_{11}}\cos 2(\phi - \gamma)\right),
        \f] where the ratio \f$S_{12}/S_{11}\f$ depends on the scattering angle \f$\theta\f$ in
        addition to wavelength.

        This can again be done through numerical inversion, by solving the equation \f[ {\cal{X}}
        =\int_{0}^{\phi}\Phi_{\theta}(\phi')\,\text{d}\phi' =\frac{1}{2\pi} \left( \phi +
        P_{\text{L}}\,\frac{S_{12}}{S_{11}} \sin\phi \cos(\phi - 2\gamma)\right) \f] for
        \f$\phi\f$, with \f${\cal{X}}\f$ being a new uniform deviate. */
