/** DustMix is the abstract base class for all classes representing the material properties of a
    dust medium. It implements the complete abstract interface defined by the MaterialMix base
    class for obtaining optical material properties. Depending on the scattering mode returned by
    the scatteringMode() function (which must be overridden by subclasses that support a scattering
    mode other than HenyeyGreenstein), the DustMix setup machinery requests the relevant optical
    dust properties from the subclass, and caches this information (possibly with some additional
    precalculated data) for later use. During the simulation, these properties can then be served
    up without further access to the subclass.

    In all cases, the properties served through the MaterialMix base class interface correspond to
    the properties of a single grain population that is representative for the complete dust mix.
    For dust mixes described by multiple grain populations, the optical properties should be
    integrated over the grain size distribution and accumulated across all grain populations. In
    the context of tracking photon paths through a dusty medium, using these integrated absorption
    and scattering cross sections and Mueller matrix coefficients is mathematically exact. In other
    words, for scattering modes MaterialPhaseFunction and SphericalPolarization, the representative
    grain approach does not involve an approximation. However, the calculation of a representative
    scattering asymmetry parameter \f$g\f$ for use with the Henyey-Greenstein scattering mode does
    involve a non-exact averaging procedure. Because the Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase
    function is non-physical to begin with, using a single approximate \f$g\f$ value for the
    complete dust mix is usually considered to be acceptable. For more information on the
    calculation of representative grain properties in SKIRT, refer to the description of the
    MultiGrainDustMix class.

    The representative grain properties offered by this class are insufficient to accurately
    calculate dust emission spectra for the dust mixture. This is so because the emission spectrum
    is a nonlinear function of (among many other things) the grain size, and thus a single grain
    cannot accurately represent a population with a (potentialy large) range of grain sizes. Again,
    refer to the description of the MultiGrainDustMix class for more information.

    The implementation of polarization by scattering in this class is based on the analysis
    presented by Peest at al. 2017 (A&A, 601, A92). */

    /** This function obtains and/or precalculates information used to serve optical properties for
        the dust mix to the simulation.

        First, it obtains the optical properties of the dust mix from the subclass on a wavelength
        grid with a range spanning all wavelengths in the simulation, and with sufficient
        resolution so that no further interpolation is needed. This includes the absorption and
        scattering cross sections, the scattering asymmetry parameter, and/or the Mueller matrix
        coefficients as required by the implemented scattering mode.

        Furthermore, if the simulation tracks the radiation field, this function precalculates the
        Planck-integrated absorption cross sections on an appropriate temperature grid. This
        information is used to obtain the equilibrium temperature of the material mix (or rather,
        of its representative grain population) in a given embedding radiation field. */

    /** This function must be implemented in each subclass to obtain the representative grain
        optical properties for the dust mix. Although the function arguments provide for all
        properties that may be required, the list of actually required properties for a particular
        subclass depends on the scattering mode advertised by the scatteringMode() function.

        The first two arguments respectively specify the wavelength grid and (if applicable) the
        scattering angle grid on which the properties must be tabulated. The function must store
        the absorption and scattering cross sections and the asymmetry parameter into the three
        subsequent output arrays, and the Mueller coefficients into the four subsequent output
        tables (indexed on wavelength and angle in that order). These arrays and tables will
        already have the appropriate size (corresponding to the input wavelength grids) when the
        function gets called. Finally, the function must return the dust mass per hydrogen atom for
        the dust mix.

        For the HenyeyGreenstein scattering mode, the function must output the cross sections and
        the asymmetry parameter, and it must leave the Mueller coeficient tables untouched. For
        scattering modes other than HenyeyGreenstein, the asymmetry parameter output array may be
        filled with "relevant" values (not used for calculations but possibly exposed to the user
        through a Probe), or it may be left untouched. For the SphericalPolarization scattering
        mode, the function must fill all four Mueller coeficient tables. For the
        MaterialPhaseFunction scattering mode, the function must fill only the first table and it
        must leave the other tables untouched.

        For the SpheroidalPolarization mode, the function must also fill the sigmaabsvv and
        sigmaabspolvv tables. */

        \f$\theta\f$, where \f${\cal{X}}\f$ is a uniform deviate.

        Once we have selected a random scattering angle \f$\theta\f$, we sample a random azimuthal
        angle \f$\phi\f$ from the normalized conditional distribution, \f[ \Phi_\theta(\phi)

        P_{\text{L}}\,\frac{S_{12}}{S_{11}} \sin\phi \cos(\phi - 2\gamma)\right) \f] for
