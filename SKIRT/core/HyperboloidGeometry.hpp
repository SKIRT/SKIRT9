/** The HyperboloidGeometry class is a subclass of the AxGeometry class and describes the geometry
    defined by a hyperboloid surface. It may be used to represent dusty outflows, extending
    vertically and then flaring towards the outside, asymptotically approaching a cone surface.

    \image html HyperboloidGeometry.png

    The current implementation allows only a constant density distribution bounded by the
    hyperboloid surface \f[ z=\frac{c}{a}\sqrt{\rho^2-a^2} \f] and two horizontal planes parallel
    to the xy plane, \f$\pm z_{\text{max}}\f$. There are four free parameters describing this dust
    geometry: the radial extent \f$D\f$, the half opening angle \f$\Delta\f$, the real axis \f$a\f$
    and the minimum radius \f$r_{\text{min}}\f$. The first two correspond to the length of the side
    and half opening angle of the cone to which the hyperboloid asymptotically approaches. The real
    axis is the radius of the hyperboloid base, i.e. the radius of the cross section of the
    hyperboloid with the xy plane. The minimum radius defines a spherical cavity centered on the
    coordinate origin. The hyperboloid formula contains two more parameters, the imaginary radius
    \f$c\f$ and the radius of the hyperboloid top surface, but these values are determined by the
    other input parameters.

    If the dusty system under consideration is surrounding an AGN or another source which is
    luminous enough to heat the dust to sublimation temperature, the inner radius should correspond
    to the sublimation radius which scale as \f$ r_{\text{min}} \propto L(\theta)^{0.5}\f$
    (Barvainis, 1987, ApJ, 320, 537, eq (5)). If the primary source assumes anisotropic emission,
    the inner radius should follow the same dependence as the distribution of the primary source
    luminosity. Otherwise, dust temperature on the inner boundary of the geometry is very likely to
    be under- or over-estimated. Thus, if the NetzerAccretionDiskGeometry distribution is chosen to
    describe the primary source emission, it is recommended to enable the "reshape inner radius"
    option. The inner radius will then be set by the following formula: \f[ r_{\text{min}} \propto
    (\cos\theta\,(2\cos\theta+1))^{0.5}.\f] This should allow dust to approach all the way to the
    primary central source in the equatorial plane. However, due to the finite resolution of dust
    cells, it may happen that some of the innermost cells end up with unphysically high
    temperatures. For this reason, there is an additional input parameter, the cutoff radius
    \f$r_{\text{cut}}\f$. The value of the cutoff radius is usually found after a few
    trial-and-error experiments by inspecting temperature distribution maps, until the inner wall
    of the geometry is at the expected sublimation temperature for a given dust population.

    The total dust mass of the model corresponds to the mass of the original geometry, before the
    inner wall is reshaped to account for anisotropy. The deviation may or may not be significant,
    depending on the volume of the entire hyperboloid compared to the central cavity; it is the
    user's responsibility to check if it is within satisfactory limits. */
