/** ProbeFormBridge is a helper class that forms a bridge between Probe and Form instances for
    form-assisted probes. The overall design objectives are described below. Refer to the
    documentation of the respective classes for more details.

    <b>Probes and forms</b>

    The idea is to allow combining two orthogonal concepts in an arbitrary fashion. The quantity
    being probed is specified by a Probe subclass, while the manner in which this quantity is being
    probed is specified by a Form subclass. Each Probe instance of this type is configured with a
    single Form instance.

    This design does not apply to all probes. It is intended for probing physical quantities that
    are defined as a scalar, vector or compound field over the spatial domain of the simulation.
    This includes two categories:

    - Spatial grid probes (inheriting the SpatialGridFormProbe class) handle quantities discretized
    over the simulation's spatial grid, including the radiation field and information stored in the
    medium state such as density, temperature, metallicity, velocity and custom variables. Because
    the quantities in this category are stored per spatial cell, they can all be probed by the same
    generic method.

    - Input model probes (inheriting the InputModelFormProbe class) handle quantities defined by
    the input model, provided the relevant data is retained in memory by the simulation, and
    provided methods exist (and are implemented) to extract the information required for probing.
    In practice, this can be achieved only in specific cases, e.g. for the set of smoothed
    particles defining the spatial distribution of a primary source. Because these quantities are
    probed directly from the original (imported) data structures, there are no (additional) grid
    effects.

    Forms describe how a given quantity should be probed. Generic forms (inheriting the GenericForm
    class) can be associated with any probe, including both spatial grid and input model probes.
    Examples include planar and linear cuts through the spatial domain, sampling at a
    user-specified list of positions, and parallel or all-sky projections. Spatial grid forms
    (inheriting the SpatialGridForm class) rely on the fact that the probed quantity is discretized
    on the simulation's spatial grid, and thus can be associated only with spatial grid probes. The
    prime (and perhaps only) example is the per-cell form.

    <b>The probe-form bridge</b>

    As can be deduced from the description above, the various types of probes and forms offer or
    require different types of primitives for retrieving probed quantity values. The
    ProbeFormBridge class provides a bridge between these differing capabilities and requirements.
    When a probe wants to output a file, it constructs a bridge instance and calls one of the
    bridge's writeQuantity() functions, passing it the appropriate information and local callback
    functions for retrieving probed quantity values on request. The bridge in turn calls the form's
    writeQuantity(bridge) function. Each Form subclass offers its own implementation of this
    function depending on the form's type of output. The form can get all required information
    through the bridge, including probed quantity values. The bridge passes the latter requests to
    the probe's call back functions, translating between request types as needed. For example, in
    the case of a spatial grid probe, a request by the form for a value at a given position is
    translated to a request for a value in the cell containing the position.

    There are several variations of the writeQuantity() function tailored to scalar, vector and
    compound quantities, and catering to spatial grid or input model probes. Because these
    functions often expect the same arguments in different combinations, all arguments are
    described here.

    - \em fileid: a string identifying the file among the possibly multiple files produced by this
    probe (e.g. "0", "1", or "dust_T"), or the empty string if such identification is not needed.

    - \em quantity, \em projectedQuantity: the quantity names (as defined in the SKIRT unit system)
    of the quantity being probed, straight (as returned by the valuesAtPosition and \em
    valuesInCell callbacks) and projected (as returned by the \em valuesAlongPath callback). These
    strings differ if the projected quantity is accumulated over distance and they are equal if the
    projected quantity is a weighted average. If these arguments are specified, the bridge performs
    all unit conversions.

    - \em unit, \em projectedUnit: the unit strings (as defined in the SKIRT unit system) of the
    quantity being probed, straight and projected. If these arguments are specified, the bridge
    does not perform any unit conversions and the probe is expected to provide values in output
    units.

    - \em description, \em projectedDescription: the user-oriented descriptions corresponding to
    the straight and projected quantities. These strings may differ even if the quantity names or
    unit strings are the same, for example, to indicate the weighting mechanism.

    - \em axis: for compound values, the values on the compound axis (e.g., wavelengths), in output
    units.

    - \em axisUnit: for compound values, the unit string for the compound axis values.

    - \em addColumnDefinitions: the callback function that will be called to add the appropriate
    column definitions if the form creates a text column output file in response to a
    writeQuantity() invocation.

    - \em valueInCell: the callback function that will be used to retrieve values of the quantity
    being probed in a spatial cell with given index. Used for spatial grid probes.

    - \em weightInCell: the callback function that will be used to retrieve the weight of the
    quantity being probed in a spatial cell with given index, in case averaging is required. Used
    for spatial grid probes.

    - \em valueAtPosition: the callback function that will be used to retrieve values of the
    quantity being probed at the specified position. Used for input model probes.

    - \em valueAlongPath: the callback function that will be used to retrieve values of the
    quantity being probed along the path starting at the specified position in the specified
    direction. Used for input model probes.
