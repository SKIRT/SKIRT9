/** ProbeFormBridge is a helper class that forms a bridge between Probe and Form instances for
    form-assisted probes. The overall design objectives are described below. Refer to the
    documentation of the respective classes for more details.

    <b>Probes and forms</b>

    The idea is to allow combining two orthogonal concepts in an arbitrary fashion. The quantity
    being probed is specified by a Probe subclass, while the manner in which this quantity is being
    probed is specified by a Form subclass. Each Probe instance of this type is configured with a
    single Form instance.

    This design does not apply to all probes. It is intended for probing physical quantities that
    are defined as a scalar, vector or compound field over the spatial domain of the simulation.
    This includes two categories:

    - Spatial grid probes (inheriting the SpatialGridFormProbe class) handle quantities discretized
    over the simulation's spatial grid, including the radiation field and information stored in the
    medium state such as density, temperature, metallicity, velocity and custom variables. Because
    the quantities in this category are stored per spatial cell, they can all be probed by the same
    generic method.

    - Input model probes (inheriting the InputModelFormProbe class) handle quantities defined by
    the input model, provided the relevant data is retained in memory by the simulation, and
    provided methods exist (and are implemented) to extract the information required for probing.
    In practice, this can be achieved only in specific cases, e.g. for the set of smoothed
    particles defining the spatial distribution of a primary source. Because these quantities are
    probed directly from the original (imported) data structures, there are no (additional) grid
    effects.

    Forms describe how a given quantity should be probed. Generic forms (inheriting the GenericForm
    class) can be associated with any probe, including both spatial grid and input model probes.
    Examples include planar and linear cuts through the spatial domain, sampling at a
    user-specified list of positions, and parallel or all-sky projections. Spatial grid forms
    (inheriting the SpatialGridForm class) rely on the fact that the probed quantity is discretized
    on the simulation's spatial grid, and thus can be associated only with spatial grid probes. The
    prime (and perhaps only) example is the per-cell form.

    <b>The probe-form bridge</b>

    As can be deduced from the description above, the various types of probes and forms offer or
    require different types of primitives for retrieving probed quantity values. The
    ProbeFormBridge class provides a bridge between these differing capabilities and requirements.
    When a probe wants to output a file, it constructs and configures a bridge instance and calls
    one of the bridge's writeFile() functions, passing it the appropriate local callback functions
    for retrieving probed quantity values on request. The bridge in turn calls the form's
    writeFile(bridge) function. Each Form subclass offers its own implementation of this function
    depending on the form's type of output. The form can get all required information through the
    bridge, including probed quantity values. The bridge passes the latter requests to the probe's
    call back functions, translating between request types as needed. For example, in the case of a
    spatial grid probe, a request by the form for a value at a given position is translated to a
    request for a value in the cell containing the position. */

    /** This function sets the properties of the quantity being probed. The probe should call
        setQuantity() before invoking writeFile(). In most cases, a single call is sufficient, even
        if muliple files are being written. However, multiple calls are allowed. For example, a
        given probe may produce mass densities for dust and number densities for gas media.

        The specified properties include:

        - The number of component values in the quantity (e.g., 1 for density, 3 for velocity,
        \f$N_\lambda\f$ for the radiation field).

        - The quantity names (as defined for the SKIRT unit system) of the quantity being probed,
        straight (as returned by the valuesAtPosition and \em valuesInCell callbacks) and projected
        (as returned by the \em valuesAlongPath callback). These strings differ if the projected
        quantity is accumulated over distance and they are equal if the projected quantity is a
        weighted average.

        - The user-oriented descriptions corresponding to the straight and projected quantities.
        These strings may differ even if the quantity names are the same, for example, to indicate
        the weighting mechanism.

        - The callback function that will be called to add the appropriate column definitions if
        the form creates a text output file in response to a writeFile() invocation. The callback
        must add exactly \em numValues column definitions. */

        a spatial grid probe, the function accesses the simulation's spatial grid to determine the
        list of path segments (traversing each cell) corresponding to the specified path, and it
        calls the \em valuesInCell callback for each cell in the list. If the straight and
        projected quantity names differ, the function calculates the accumulated quantity
        \f$\Sigma_m Q_m \Delta s_m\f$. If the quantity names are the same, it calculates the
        weigthed average \f$\Sigma_m Q_m w_m \Delta s_m / \Sigma_m w_m \Delta s_m\f$, where the
        weigths are retrieved by calling the \em weightInCell callback for each cell. */
