/** AbsorptionOnlyMaterialMixDecorator is a material mix decorator that removes scattering from any
    material mix, passing through just the absorption properties. It can be used to evaluate the
    effects of scattering on observations. As a result, one can use SKIRT to test different
    versions of approximate radiation transfer:

    - a version that accounts for scattering out of the line of sight but neglects scattering into
    the line of sight; this can be obtained from the direct flux offered by the SKIRT instruments.

    - a version that neglects scattering both out of and into the line of sight; this can be
    obtained by removing all scattering from the material mix using this decorator.

    ## Fragmented dust mixes

    When working with fragmented dust mixes, first apply the FragmentDustMixDecorator to the
    original MultiGrainDustMix and then apply the AbsorptionOnlyMaterialMixDecorator to the
    FragmentDustMixDecorator. The other way around doesn't work because the
    FragmentDustMixDecorator explicitly expects a MultiGrainDustMix while the
    AbsorptionOnlyMaterialMixDecorator inherits directly from MaterialMix. This is not really a
    limitation as the intended goal is properly achieved.

    ## Limitations

    The current implementation of this decorator does not support secondary emission. To make this
    work, the decorator would need to pass through all material mix functions related to dust
    and/or gas emission, and the dynamic casting of material mix subclasses in the secondary
    emission framework would need to be replaced by the SimulationItem::interface() mechanism.

    Similarly, the current implementation of the decorator does not support dynamic dust
    destruction. To make this work, the decorator would need to implement the additional functions
    in the FragmentDustMixDecorator class provided for this purpose as a separate interface, and
    the DustDestructionRecipe class would need to use this interface rather than calling the
    FragmentDustMixDecorator class directly. */
