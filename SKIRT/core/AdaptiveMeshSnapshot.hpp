/** An AdaptiveMeshSnapshot object represents a three-dimensional Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)
    grid and offers several related interrogation facilities. As implemented by this class, an
    adaptive mesh recursively partitions a cuboidal spatial domain into cuboidal (sub)cells. In
    contrast to an octree, which has a fixed 2x2x2 subdivision scheme, an adaptive mesh uses an
    arbitrary scheme that can (and must) be specified for each subdivision seperately. As a result,
    an adaptive mesh can provide high resolution (i.e. small cells) in areas where it matters,
    without consuming memory in areas where the resolution can be lower, in a very flexible manner.

    The primary objective of the AdaptiveMeshSnapshot class is to represent snapshot data produced
    by a hydrodynamical simulation and imported from a column text file, defining a primary source
    or a transfer medium distribution. To support this use case, the class is based on the Snapshot
    class; it uses the facilities offered there to configure and help read the snapshot data, and
    it implements all functions in the general Snapshot public interface. In addition it offers
    functionality that is specific to this snapshot type, such as, for example, the requirement to
    configure the spatial extent of the domain. A client should employ the default
    AdaptiveMeshSnapshot constructor and configure the snapshot object as described in the Snapshot
    class header.

    Additionally, once a snapshot has been imported, the adaptive mesh defined by the snapshot can
    in some cases also be used to discretize the spatial domain as a basis for the radiative
    transfer simulation itself. To support this use case, the class offers the capability to trace
    a linear path through the adaptive mesh.

    Once an AdaptiveMeshSnapshot object has been constructed and fully configured, its data is no
    longer modified. Consequently all getters are re-entrant.

    Tree structure, Morton ordering, and file format
    ------------------------------------------------

    The adaptive mesh data structure is organized in a tree. Each tree node represents a cubodial
    portion of the domain, called its extent. The root node's extent is the complete domain. A
    nonleaf node distributes its extent over its child nodes using a regular linear grid. The
    number of subdivisions is defined separately for each node and can differ for each spatial
    dimension. A leaf node represents a cell in which physical quantities are considered to be
    constant. Collectively the leaf nodes form a partition of the domain, i.e. their extents cover
    the complete domain without overlapping one another.

    The cells in this three-dimensional data structure can be arranged in a linear sequence using
    Morton ordering. This ordering is obtained by performing a depth-first traversal of the tree,
    where each nonleaf node outputs its children in the order x-first, then y, then z.

    When reading an adaptive mesh snapshot from a text column input file, each line in the file
    describes a particular tree node (nonleaf or leaf), and the lines are given in Morton order.
    Specifically, each line in the file can be one of the following types:

     - Comment: lines with a crosshatch (#) as the first non-whitespace character, lines
       containing only whitespace and empty lines are ignored (and do not count in the Morton order).
     - Nonleaf: a nonleaf line has an exclamation mark (!) as the first non-whitespace character,
       followed by optional whitespace and then three whitespace-separated positive integer numbers
       \f$N_x,N_y,N_z\f$. These three numbers specify the number of child nodes carried by this node
       in each spatial direction. The child nodes are on a regular linear grid as described above.
     - Leaf: a leaf node contains one or more whitespace-separated floating point numbers reflecting
       the physical quantities associated with the leaf node, depending on the user configuration
       settings for the snapshot. The default units for these quantities can be overridden by
       including columns header info in the file as described in the TextInFile class header.

    Note that the input file does not include the physical extent of the domain; this information
    must be provided as part of the user configuration for the snapshot.

    Below is an example of an adaptive mesh import file. For illustrative purposes:

      - the mesh is assumed to have a single cell in the z direction;
      - the value in the first colum indicates the Morton order index of the leaf cell;
      - the values in the remaining two columns indicate the x and y coordinates of
        the cell's center using a domain of size 4. x 3. with one corner at the origin.
