/** WavelengthGrid is an abstract class that defines the interface for wavelength grids that can be
    used, for example, to specify the wavelength bins used for detetecting photon packets in
    instruments.

    A wavelength grid consists of \f$N>0\f$ possibly overlapping wavelength bins. Generally
    speaking, each of these bins is defined through a transmission curve determining the
    contribution fraction of a detected photon packet to the bin as a function of wavelength. This
    class defines the public interface for a wavelength grid in these general terms. Subclasses can
    implement several bin types, including bins that mimic a particular broadband, or
    straightforward bins with constant transmission across some wavelength interval.

    Key properties of a wavelength bin include its left and right borders, defining a wavelength
    interval within which the transmission may be nonzero, and its characteristic wavelength, which
    will be used by instruments to convert mean specific luminosities in the band between
    wavelength and frequency representations. The WavelengthGrid class requires that the
    characteristic wavelength of a bin falls inside the bin, i.e. \f$\lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell \le
    \lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell \le \lambda^\mathrm{right}_\ell, \ell=0\dots N-1\f$, and that no two bins
    have the same characteristic wavelength. This allows the WavelengthGrid class to meaningfully
    sort bins in increasing order of characteristic wavelength, and assign bin indices accordingly.

    The public interface also includes functions to obtain the relative transmission for a given
    bin as a function of wavelength, defined as the transmission at that wavelength divided by the
    maximum transmission, and to obtain a bin's effective width, defined as the horizontal size of
    a rectangle with height equal to the maximum transmission and with the same area as the one
    covered by the band's transmission curve.

    Finally, and most importantly, the public interface offers a function to determine the (indices
    of) the bin(s) that may have a nonzero transmission at a given wavelength. */
