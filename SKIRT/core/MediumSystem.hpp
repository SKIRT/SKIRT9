/** An instance of the MediumSystem class represents a complete medium system, which is the
    superposition of one or more transfer media. Each individual medium represents a spatial
    density distribution and defines the material properties of the medium at each location. While
    the specific material properties may vary with location, the fundamental material type must be
    the same throughout the spatial domain for each medium.

    In addition to the media input model, the MediumSystem class includes the spatial grid that
    tessellates the spatial domain of the simulation into cells, and manages the medium state and
    the radiation field for each spatial cell in this grid.

    The current implementation focuses on electrons and dust (i.e. there are no provisions for gas)
    and assumes that the density distribution and material mix remain constant after setup (i.e.
    there are no iterations for dust destruction). This will change as additional features are
    added.

    The medium state includes the following information for each cell in the spatial grid: the
    number density in the cell per medium component; (a pointer to) the corresponding material mix
    for each medium component; the aggregate bulk velocity of the material in the cell; the
    magnetic field vector in the cell, and the volume of the cell.

    The contribution to the radation field for each spatial cell and for each wavelength in the
    simulation's radiation field wavelength grid is traced separately for primary and secondary
    sources. This avoids the need for repeating primary emission during dust-temperature
    convergence iterations. At all times, the sum of the primary and secondary contributions
    represents the radiation field to be used as input for calculations. There is a third,
    temporary table that serves as a target for storing the secondary radiation field so that the
    "stable" primary and secondary tables remain available for calculating secondary emission
    spectra while shooting secondary photons through the grid. */
