/** An instance of the MediumSystem class represents a complete medium system, which is the
    superposition of one or more transfer media. Each individual medium represents a spatial
    density distribution and defines the material properties of the medium at each location. While
    the specific material properties may vary with location, the fundamental material type must be
    the same throughout the spatial domain for each medium.

    In addition to the media input model, the MediumSystem class includes the spatial grid that
    tessellates the spatial domain of the simulation into cells, and manages the medium state and
    the radiation field for each spatial cell in this grid. The class therefore plays a central
    role in the simulation and it offers quite a few different type of functions.

    <b>Overall medium configuration</b>

    These functions offer basic information on the spatial grid, the medium components, and the
    material types in the medium system.

    <b>%Medium state</b>

    The medium state for each spatial cell in the simulation includes a set of \em common state
    variables shared by all medium components and a set of \em specific state variables for each
    individual medium component. See the MediumState class for more information. The functions in
    this section allow access to the common state variables for a given spatial cell.

    <b>Low-level optical properties</b>

    These functions allow retrieving absorption, scattering and extinction cross sections for a
    given spatial cell and material type as a function of wavelength, assuming fixed, predefined
    values for any quantities other than wavelength (e.g., a default temperature, no polarization,
    no kinematics). The values returned by these low-level functions may be used only during setup
    and for probing.

    <b>High-level photon life cycle</b>

    These functions support the photon life cycle by offering a generic interface for operations
    including tracing photon paths through the medium and performing scattering events. The
    functions calculate opacities and other medium properties in a given spatial cell by passing
    the incoming photon packet and the full medium state to the appropriate material mix for each
    medium component. This allows proper treatment of polarization and kinematics and supports
    dependencies on temperature or custom special state variables.

    <b>Radiation field</b>

    These functions allow storing the radiation field during the photon life cycle and retrieving
    the results after a set of photon's have been processed. The contribution to the radation field
    for each spatial cell and for each wavelength in the simulation's radiation field wavelength
    grid is traced separately for primary and secondary sources. This avoids the need for repeating
    primary emission during dust-temperature convergence iterations. At all times, the sum of the
    primary and secondary contributions represents the radiation field to be used as input for
    calculations. There is a third, temporary table that serves as a target for storing the
    secondary radiation field so that the "stable" primary and secondary tables remain available
    for calculating secondary emission spectra while shooting secondary photons through the grid.

    <b>Indicative temperature</b>

    These functions determine an indicative temperature in a given spatial cell and for a given
    material type, averaged over medium components if applicable. Depending on the material type,
    the indicative temperature may be based on the radiation field or it may be derived from a
    value given in the input model. In any case, it does not reflect a physical quantity and it
    should be used only for setup and probing purposes.

    <b>Emission</b>

    These functions support the secondary source system by offering a generic interface for
    calculating the secondary emission properties in a given spatial cell and for a given material
    type, including luminosities, spectra and polarization. */

    /** This function calculates the cumulative extinction optical depth at the end of each path
        segment along a path through the medium system defined by the initial position and
        direction of the specified PhotonPacket object, and stores the results of the calculation
        into the same PhotonPacket object.

        This function is intended for handling random-walk photon packet paths during a photon life
        cycle that \em does use forced-scattering, requiring the optical depth to be calculated for
        the full path until it reaches the model boundary. Moreover, the function is intended for a
        photon life cycle that does \em not use explicit absorption, so it suffices to consider the
        extinction optical depth (without discriminating between scattering and absorption).

        Because the function is at the heart of the photon life cycle, performance is important.
        Firstly, separating the geometric and optical depth calculations seems to be faster,
        probably due to memory access and caching issues. So the function first determines and
        stores the path segments and then calculates and stores the cumulative optical depth at the
        end of each segment. Secondly, the function implements optimized versions for media with
        spatially constant cross sections.

        With the geometric path information given, the function calculates the extinction optical
        depth for each path segment \f$(\Delta s)_m\f$ as it crosses the spatial cell with index
        \f$m\f$ as \f[ \tau_m^\text{ext} = (\Delta s)_m \sum_h k_{m,h}^\text{ext}, \f] where
        \f$k_{m,h}^\text{ext}\f$ is the extinction opacity corresponding to the \f$h\f$'th medium
        component in the cell with index \f$m\f$ and the sum over \f$h\f$ runs over all medium
        components. The opacities \f$k_{m,h}^\text{ext}\f$ are calculated at the wavelength
        perceived by the medium in cell \f$m\f$ taking into account the bulk velocity and Hubble
        expansion velocity in that cell, and taking into account any relevant properties of the
        incoming photon packet such as the polarization state.

        Using these optical depth values per segment, the function determines the cumulative

        This function is intended for handling random-walk photon packet paths during a photon life
        cycle that \em does use forced-scattering, requiring the optical depths to be calculated
        for the full path until it reaches the model boundary. Moreover, the function is intended
        for a photon life cycle that \em does use explicit absorption. In this case, the next
        interaction point is determined based on the scattering optical depth (as opposed to the
        total extinction optical depth), so we need to calculate and store the scattering and
        absorption optical depths separately.

        Because it is at the heart of the photon life cycle, performance is important. Firstly,
        separating the geometric and optical depth calculations seems to be faster, probably due to
        memory access and caching issues. So the function first determines and stores the path
        segments and then calculates and stores the cumulative optical depths at the end of each
        segment. Secondly, the function implements optimized versions for media with spatially
        constant cross sections.

        With the geometric path information given, the function calculates the scattering and
        absorption optical depths for each path segment \f$(\Delta s)_m\f$ as it crosses the
        spatial cell with index \f$m\f$ as \f[ \tau_m^\text{sca,abs} = (\Delta s)_m \sum_h
        k_{m,h}^\text{sca,abs}, \f] where \f$k_{m,h}^\text{sca,abs}\f$ represent the scattering and
        absorption opacities corresponding to the \f$h\f$'th medium component in the cell with
        index \f$m\f$ and the sum over \f$h\f$ runs over all medium components. The opacities
        \f$k_{m,h}^\text{sca,abs}\f$ are calculated at the wavelength perceived by the medium in
        cell \f$m\f$ taking into account the bulk velocity and Hubble expansion velocity in that
        cell, and taking into account any relevant properties of the incoming photon packet such as
        the polarization state.

        Using these optical depth values per segment, the function determines the cumulative
        optical depths at the segment exit boundaries and stores them into the specified photon
        packet object. Note that the optical depth at entry of the initial segment is equal to zero
        by definition. */

        optical depth along its path is higher than \f$ \tau_\mathrm{max} = \ln(L/L_\mathrm{min})
