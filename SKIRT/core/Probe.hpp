/** Probe is an abstract class representing probes that output information on internal simulation
    data before or during the simulation run. Refer to the ProbeSystem class for more information.

    Probe subclasses \em must adhere to the following rules. In this discussion, \em target refers
    to the item(s) in the simulation hierarchy from which the probe retrieves information.
    - Data encapsulation: a probe can use public interfaces only, even if these interfaces are in
      some cases written specifically to support the probe (refer to the scenarios described in
      the ProbeSystem class).
    - Read-only access: a probe cannot (cause to) change the data structures held by the target.
      There are two exceptions to this rule: (1) during its own setup, a probe can cause setup of
      a target through the find() or interface() functions, and (2) a probe can use a public
      function, provided by the target for this purpose, to install a call-back function that will
      be invoked by the target.
    - Interprobe independence: a probe cannot look for or depend on another probe, nor on the order
      of the various probes in the list held by the probe system.
