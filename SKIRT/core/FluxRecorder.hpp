/** FluxRecorder is a helper class used by instruments to actually record the effects of detected
    photon packets. Each Instrument instance employs a single FluxRecorder instance.

    Features
    --------

    Depending on an instrument's needs, a FluxRecorder instance records an %SED (spectral energy
    density) with a spatially integrated flux density for each wavelength bin, and/or a full IFU
    (integral field unit data cube) with a surface brightness for each pixel in an image frame for
    each wavelength bin. In each case, flux information can be recorded and written to file
    depending on user configuration.

    Specifically, the class can record the individual contributions to the total flux from primary
    and secondary sources (i.e. emission by media), in each case splitting direct and scattered
    radiation. It can also store the flux as it would be seen without any attenuation, i.e. a
    transparent view of the system as if there were no media. Furthermore, the contributions from
    individual scattering levels (for primary radiation only) up to a certain maximum level can be
    recorded separately. When the maximum level is set to zero, this feature is disabled. Finally,
    the class can also record the elements of the Stokes vector for the total flux, \f$(I, Q, U,
    V)\f$, where the intensity \f$I\f$ corresponds to the total flux itself. Note that the Stokes
    \f$Q, U, V\f$ "flux" values can be negative.

    Upon request, the class can also record information intended for calculating statistical
    properties of the results. Let \f$N\f$ denote the number of primary and secondary photon
    packets launched during the peel-off segments of the simulation. We define \f$w_i,
    i=1,\dots,N\f$ as the contribution of the \f$i\f$th photon packet to a particular bin (a
    wavelength bin for an %SED, or a pixel in one of the wavelength frames for an IFU). The value
    of \f$w_i\f$ includes the contributions of all photon packets peeled-off and/or scattered from
    the originally launched packet (called the \em history of that packet). Given this definition,
    the class tracks and outputs the sums \f$\sum_i w_i^k\f$, with \f$k=0,\dots,4\f$ for each bin.
    These sums allow calculating second order statistical properties such as the relative error
    \f$R\f$ and fourth order statistical properties such as the variance of the variance VOV. For
    more information, see, e.g., the user manual for the MCNP code (A General Monte Carlo
    N-Particle Transport Code, Version 5, April 24, 2003, Revised 2/1/2008, Los Alamos National
    Laboratory, USA) or Camps and Baes 2018 (ApJ).

    All of these output possibilities are summarized in the table below. A separate IFU output file
    is written for each line in the table; the first column in the table lists the portion of the
    output filename <tt>prefix_instr_XXX.fits</tt> indicating the IFU type. Note that an output
    file is created only if the corresponding information has been requested \em and it is
    meaningful. For example, if the transparent flux is know to be identical to the total flux
    (because there are no media), the transparent file is not written. Also, if the simulation does
    not include media emission, the secondary flux files are not written.

    IFU file name          | Description | Configured by
    -----------------------|-------------|--------------
    total                  | Total attenuated flux | always on
    transparent            | Transparent flux from primary sources | \em recordComponents = true
    primarydirect          | Direct, unscattered flux from primary sources | \em recordComponents = true
    primaryscattered       | Indirect, scattered flux from primary sources | \em recordComponents = true
    primaryscatteredN      | Flux from primary sources that has scattered N times | .. & \em numScatteringLevels > 0
    secondarytransparent   | Transparent flux emitted by media | \em recordComponents = true
    secondarydirect        | Direct, unscattered flux emitted by media | \em recordComponents = true
    secondaryscattered     | Indirect, scattered flux emitted by media | \em recordComponents = true
    stokesQ                | Stokes vector element Q for total flux | \em recordPolarization = true
    stokesU                | Stokes vector element U for total flux | \em recordPolarization = true
    stokesV                | Stokes vector element V for total flux | \em recordPolarization = true
    statsN                 | Sum of individual photon contributions to the power of N | \em recordStatistics = true

    The %SED information is written in a maximum of two text column files. The first file, called
    <tt>prefix_instr_sed.txt</tt>, includes a column for each of the requested flux components in
    the order indicated by the table below. The columns for each block are either all present or
    all absent as requested in the configuration, even if the numbers are zero or identical to
    other columns. This allows the column indices to be determined solely based on knowledge of the
    instrument configuration flags, without taking into account whether the simulation actually
    includes the corresponding feature (e.g., media emission or polarization).

    Block                                  | Configured by
    ---------------------------------------|--------------
    Total flux                             | always on
    Transparent fluxes and flux components | \em recordComponents = true
    Stokes vector elements                 | \em recordPolarization = true
    N-times scattered primary flux         | \em recordComponents = true & \em numScatteringLevels > 0

    The second file, called <tt>prefix_instr_sedstats.txt</tt>, is written only if statistics are
    requested. It includes a column for the wavelength plus a column for each of the individual
    photon contribution sums, for powers from zero to 4.

    Calling sequence
    ----------------

    A FluxRecorder instance expects a rigourous calling sequence. During setup, the instrument
    configures the FluxRecorder's operation, specifying the wavelength grid, the items to be
    recorded (%SED, IFU, individual flux components, statistics), flux calibration settings
    (instrument type, distance, redshift), and some additional information on the simulation in
    which the instrument is embedded (e.g., is there any secondary emission). The configuration
    must be completed by calling the finalizeConfiguration() function.

    To record the effects of detecting a photon packet, the instrument invokes the detect()
    function. This function is thread-safe, so it may be (and often is) called from multiple
    parallel execution threads. After the parallel threads have completed the work on a series of
    photon packets, and before the parallel threads are actually destructed, the instrument should
    call the flush() function from a single thread to process any information buffered by the
    detect() function in thread-local storage. Finally, at the end of the simulation, the
    instrument calls the calibrateAndWrite() function to output the recorded information.

    Flux calibration
    ----------------

    A FluxRecorder instance handles the conversion of the detected photon packet contributions to a
    corresponding observed quantity for each spectral and/or spatial bin. This process is called
    flux calibration and it depends to some extent on whether the instrument associated with the
    flux recorder is "distant" or "local".

    A distant instrument is placed at a large distance from the model under study. The observed
    portion of the sky is approximated by a plane perpendicular to the line of sight rather than a
    part of a sphere. The instrument uses parallel projection and considers all photon packets to
    originate at the same distance from the instrument. Consequently, the incoming photon packet
    contributions can simply be accumulated for each bin and flux calibration can occur on the
    aggregated result. Assuming a non-relativistic distance, the calibration for the flux densities
    \f$F_\lambda\f$ in an %SED is \f[ F_\lambda = \frac{1}{\Delta\lambda} \, \frac{1}{4\pi
    d_\mathrm{m}^2} \, L_\mathrm{bin}\f] where \f$L_\mathrm{bin}\f$ is the aggregated photon packet
    luminosity contribution in a spectral bin, \f$\Delta\lambda\f$ is the width of that bin, and
    \f$d_\mathrm{m}\f$ is the distance from the model to the instrument. The calibration for the
    surface brightness values \f$f_\lambda\f$ in an IFU is \f[ f_\lambda = \frac{1}{\Delta\lambda}
    \, \frac{1}{4\pi d_\mathrm{m}^2} \, \frac{1}{\Omega_\mathrm{distant}}\, L_\mathrm{bin}\f] where
    \f$\Omega_\mathrm{distant}\f$ is the solid angle subtended by the detector pixel corresponding
    to the bin. For a distant instrument using parallel projection, the latter is given by
    \f[\Omega_\mathrm{distant} = 4\arctan\left(\frac{s_\mathrm{x}}{2d_\mathrm{m}}\right)
    \arctan\left(\frac{s_\mathrm{y}}{2d_\mathrm{m}}\right) \f] where \f$s_\mathrm{x}\f$ and
    \f$s_\mathrm{y}\f$ represent the field of view (in model units) of a pixel in each direction.
    For relativistic distances these relations become slightly more involved, as discussed in a
    seperate concept note on cosmological redshift.

    A local instrument is placed near or even inside the model. The mapping between incoming photon
    packet trajectories and detector pixels is determined by the instrument. Although all distances
    are considered to be non-relativistic, photon packets can now originate at various distances
    from the instrument, with a wide dynamic range. The FluxRecorder class does not support
    recording %SEDs for local instruments. The calibration for the surface brightness values
    \f$f_\lambda\f$ in an IFU now becomes \f[ f_\lambda = \frac{1}{\Delta\lambda} \, \frac{1}{4\pi
    d_\mathrm{pp}^2} \, \frac{1}{\Omega_\mathrm{local}}\, L_\mathrm{pp}\f] where
    \f$L_\mathrm{pp}\f$ is the luminosity contribution by a particular photon packet,
    \f$d_\mathrm{pp}\f$ is the distance of the packet's originating position to the instrument, and
    \f$\Omega_\mathrm{local}\f$ is the solid angle subtended by the detector pixel corresponding to
    the bin. The correction for distance now must be performed for each photon packet individually.
    Furthermore, the solid angle subtended by a detector pixel now depends on the projection
    applied by the instrument. The current implementation assumes that the solid angle is identical
    for all pixels in the detector, alhough this is not generally true for all instrument
    projections. In that case, the instrument should specify a representative value and advise the
    user to avoid situations where the actual solid angles deviate much from this value.

    Memory usage
    ------------

    A FluxRecorder instance dynamically adjusts its memory allocation to the configuration and
    simulation characteristics. Detector arrays for individual flux components, polarization, or
    statistics are allocated only when requested in the configuration. Also, for example, if there
    is no secondary emission in the simulation, the corresponding detector arrays are not
    allocated, even if recording of individual components is requested in the configuration.
