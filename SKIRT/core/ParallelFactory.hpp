/** A ParallelFactory object serves as a factory for instances of Parallel subclasses, called its
    children. An important property of a factory object is the maximum number of parallel execution
    threads per process to be handed to its children. During construction of a ParallelFactory
    instance, the maximum thread count is set to the return value of the defaultThreadCount()
    function. The value can be changed after construction by calling the setMaxThreadCount()
    function, but it should not be changed after any children have been requested. When requesting
    a new child, the client can specify a more stringent limit on the number of threads, but the
    factory's limit is never exceeded. This allows a client to request a Parallel object with a
    smaller number of threads, usually for performance reasons.

    A factory object assumes ownership for all its children. If a child of the appropriate type
    (see below) and with the appropriate number of threads already exists, it will be handed out
    again. As a result, a particular Parallel instance may be reused several times, reducing the
    overhead of creating and destroying the threads. However, the children of a particular factory
    should \em never be used in parallel. Also, recursively invoking the call() function on a
    Parallel instance is not allowed and results in undefined behavior. The recommended use is to
    have a single ParallelFactory instance per simulation, and to use yet another ParallelFactory
    instance to run multiple simulations at the same time.

    ParallelFactory clients can request a Parallel instance for one of the two task allocation
    modes described in the table below.

    Task mode | Description
    ----------|------------
    Distributed | All threads in all processes perform the tasks in parallel
    RootOnly | All threads in the root process perform the tasks in parallel; the other processes ignore the tasks

    In support of these task modes, the Parallel class has several subclasses, each implementing
    a specific parallelization scheme as described in the table below.

    Shorthand | %Parallel subclass | Description
    ----------|-----------------|------------
    S | SerialParallel | Single thread in the current process; isolated from any other processes
    MT | MultiThreadParallel | Multiple coordinated threads in the current process; isolated from any other processes
    MTP | MultiHybridParallel | One or more threads in each of multiple processes, all coordinated as a group
    0 | NullParallel | No operation; any requests for performing tasks are ignored

    Depending on the requested task mode and the current run-time configuration (number of processes
    and number of threads in each process), a ParallelFactory object hands out the appropriate
    Parallel subclass as listed in the table below. (Header: P=process, T=thread, 1=one, M=multiple.)

    Mode/Runtime | 1P 1T | 1P MT | MP 1T | MP MT |
    -------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
    Distributed  |  S    |  MT   |  MTP  |  MTP  |
    RootOnly     |  S    |  MT   |  S/0  |  MT/0 |
