/** BandWavelengthGrid is an asbtract class for representing wavelength grids where each bin is
    defined by a Band object. Each Band object provides the transmission curve and the other
    (derived) properties for the corresponding bin. Examples include the standard Johnson filters
    and the broadbands for actual observatories such as GALEX, SDSS or Herschel. See the Band class
    for more information.

    Each subclass must override the bandList() method to return a list of Band objects. The bands
    are automatically sorted in order of increasing pivot wavelength, even if the list returned by
    the subclass has them in a different order. The intervals in which the transmission is nonzero
    is allowed to overlap, but no two bands in the list should have the same pivot wavelength (this
    restriction essentially disallows specifying the same band twice). */
