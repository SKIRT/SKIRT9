/** An instance of the ToddlersSEDFamily class represents the TODDLERS (Time evolution of Dust
    Diagnostics and Line Emission from Regions containing young Stars) family of star-forming
    region SEDs parameterized on age, metallicity, star formation efficiency, and cloud number
    density. This %SED template library is described in detail by Kapoor et al. in the manuscript
    submitted to MNRAS on May 26, 2023. The spectra were generated using the Cloudy master branch
    commit with SHA 69c3fa5871da3262341910e37c6ed2e5fb76dd3c.

    The SEDs in the TODDLERS library are tabulated over a wavelength range from \f$0.01\f$ to
    \f$3000~\mu\mathrm{m}\f$ and include both continuum and line emission. The low-resolution
    version of the library uses the default Cloudy output resolution of \f$R= \lambda/\Delta\lambda
    = 300\f$ to represent both the line and continuum components as calculated by Cloudy, resulting
    in 3787 wavelength points. The high-resolution version includes a large subset of the emission
    lines (as detailed in the paper), represented using high-resolution Gaussian line profiles with
    \f$R= \lambda/\Delta\lambda_\mathrm{G} = 5\times 10^4\f$, where \f$\Delta\lambda_\mathrm{G}\f$
    is the width of the \f$4 \sigma\f$ truncated Gaussian. These line profiles are added to the
    default \f$R=300\f$ resolution Cloudy continuum, resulting in a total of 9756 wavelength points
    with the overall spectral resolution structure shown below.

    The TODDLERS parameter space spans 90 ages from 0.1-30 Myr, 5 metallicity values from
    0.001-0.04, 7 star formation efficiencies from 0.01-0.15, and 9 cloud number densities from 
    10-2560 \f$\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\f$. The PAH-to-dust fraction is a maximum value scaled by the 
    neutral hydrogen abundance in component shells/clouds. Two maximum PAH fractions are available:
    High = 4.6%, Low = 1%.

    Finally, the SEDs are scaled by the mass of the imported star-forming region particle. The
    scaling assumes a cloud mass function obeying a power law with slope -1.8, i.e., \f$dN/dM
    \propto M^{-1.8}\f$ running from a cloud mass of \f$10^5\f$ to
    \f$10^{6.75}~\mathrm{M}_\odot\f$, sampled using 8 equi-logspaced cloud masses. Given the age
    range of the library, stellar particles younger than 30 Myr should be considered as
    star-forming region candidates, with their \em initial mass as the mass used for scaling.

    When imported from a text column file, the parameters for this %SED family must appear in the
    following order in the specified default units (unless these units are overridden by column
    header info): \f[ t\,(\mathrm{yr}) \quad Z\,(\mathrm{dimensionless}) \quad
    \mathrm{SFE}\,(\mathrm{dimensionless}) \quad n_\mathrm{cloud} (\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \quad
    M\,(\mathrm{M}_\odot) \f] */
