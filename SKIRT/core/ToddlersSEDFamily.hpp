/** TODDLERS = Time evolution of Dust Diagnostics and Line Emission from Regions
    containing young Stars. 
    
    An instance of the ToddlersSEDFamily class represents the family of 
    Toddlers star-region template SEDs, parameterized on age, metallicity,
    star formation efficiency, and cloud number density. The 
    SED is scaled by the particle mass.
    The scaling assumes a cloud mass function obeying a power law with slope of -1.8, i.e.,
    dN/dM \propto M^{-1.8} running from cloud mass of 1e5 - 1e6.75 Msun.
    The model spectra have 9756 wavelengths and cover 90 ages from .1-30Myr, 5 metallicity values from
    .001 to .04 (solar being .014), 7 star formation efficiencies from 1 - 15 %, and 9 cloud number
    densities ranging from 10 cm^{-3} to 2560 cm^{-3}.
	The PAH fraction is a maximal value scaled by the neutral Hydrogen abundance in a shell, 
	two maximum q_PAH values are avaiable: High(Default) = 4.6 %, Low = 1 %.
    Additionally, this class allows the use of low resolution (R=300) as well as high resolution spectra
    to represent the total SED (line + continuum). In the case of high resolution case, the lines are 
    at high resolution while the continua is the same as the low resolution case.
    The SEDs are tabulated over a wavelength range from 100 Angstrom to 3000 micron.
    The data was generated using the Cloudy master branch.
    
    For more details refer to Kapoor et al 2023 .
