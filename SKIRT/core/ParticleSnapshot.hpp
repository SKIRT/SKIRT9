/** A ParticleSnapshot object represents the data in a smoothed particle (SPH) snapshot imported
    from a column text file. The class is based on the Snapshot class; it uses the facilities
    offered there to configure and read the snapshot data, and it implements all functions in the
    general Snapshot public interface. In addition it offers functionality that is specific to this
    snapshot type, such as, for example, the ability to use an arbitrary smoothing kernel for the
    particles in the snapshot.

    If the snapshot configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a given spatial
    position, a lot of effort is made to accelerate the density interpolation over a potentially
    large number of smoothed particles. */
