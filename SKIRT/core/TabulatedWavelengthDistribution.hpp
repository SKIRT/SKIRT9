/** TabulatedWavelengthDistribution is an abstract class for representing wavelength probability
    distributions that are tabulated by the user in the form of wavelength/probability pairs. The
    probability distribution function is defined segment-wise by the tabulated values, using
    logarithmic interpolation. The wavelengths must be listed in increasing or decreasing order.
    Probability values outside the range indicated by the first and the last tabulated wavelength
    are considered to be zero. In addition, this range is intersected with the wavelength range of
    the associated source (obtained through the SourceWavelengthRangeInterface) before the
    distribution is normalized.

    The subclass must load the tabulated data, and this abstract class handles everything else. */
