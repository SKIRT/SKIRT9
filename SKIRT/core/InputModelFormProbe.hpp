/** InputModelFormProbe is a base class for probes that cooperate with any generic Form subclass to
    describe how the considered input model quantity should be probed. This does not include forms
    that require the spatial grid of the simulation to be present. See the ProbeFormBridge class
    for more information.

    This class offers facilities for subclasses that probe imported source or media components.
    Imported sources are always handled together, i.e. aggregated system-wide, because it is not
    meaningful to average properties over each source individually. Imported media are handled per
    component, because aggregating various medium components can be ambiguous (e.g., they may be
    defined in terms of number or mass density). If probes would be developed that access other
    aspects of the input model, this may require additional functionality in this class or an extra
    intermediate layer of subclasses. */
