/** The abstract ClipGeometryDecorator class implements a decorator that adjusts another geometry
    by setting the density equal to zero inside or outside a region defined in a subclass. Each
    ClipGeometryDecorator subclass must implement the virtual functions dimension() and inside().
    The decorator increases the density in the remaining region with a constant factor to ensure
    that the total mass remains equal to one. The current implementation does not properly adjust
    the surface densities along the coordinate axes for the mass taken away by the cavity. */
