/** This class implements the Parallel base class interface using multiple threads in each of
    multiple processes. In each process, the actual work is performed in child threads created for
    that purpose, while the parent thread is used for communication among the processes (the MPI
    functions should be called only from the main thread). In the root process, the parent thread
    serves chunks of work to the other processes. In the non-root processes, the parent thread
    requests chunks from the root process for all of the local parallel threads. The extra thread
    in each process is not counted towards the number of threads specified by the user because the
    communication does not consume significant resources.

    This class uses the facilities offered by the MultiParallel base class. */
