/** The ComptonPhaseFunction helper class represents Compton scattering of photons by free
    electrons. The current implementation does not support polarization.

    Compton scattering forms the extension of Thomson scattering into the high-photon-energy
    domain. The scattering event is elastic (i.e. the photon wavelength is changed by the
    interaction) and its cross section and phase function depend on the wavelength of the incoming
    photon. Compared to Thomson scattering, the total cross section is reduced at higher energies.
    With \f$x = (h\nu)/(m_e c^2)\f$ the incoming photon energy scaled to the electron rest energy,
    the ratio of the total Compton scattering cross section \f$\sigma_\mathrm{C}(x)\f$ over the
    (constant) total Thomson cross section \f$\sigma_\mathrm{T}\f$ is given by:

    \f[ \frac{\sigma_\mathrm{C}(x)}{\sigma_\mathrm{T}} = \frac{3}{4} \bigg( \frac{1+x}{(1+2x)^2} +
    \frac{2}{x^2} + \Big(\frac{1}{2x}-\frac{1+x}{x^3}\Big) \cdot \ln(1+2x) \bigg). \f]

    For an interaction with incoming photon energy \f$x\f$ and scattering angle \f$\theta\f$, the
    energy change \f$E_\mathrm{out}/E_\mathrm{in}\f$ is given by the Compton factor \f$C(x, \theta)
    = \big(1+x(1-\cos \theta)\big)^{-1}\f$. Equivalently, the wavelength change is given by
    \f$\lambda_\mathrm{out} / \lambda_\mathrm{in} = \big(1+x(1-\cos \theta)\big)\f$.

    The normalized phase function for an interaction with incoming photon energy \f$x\f$ is given
    by:

    \f[ \Phi(x, \theta) = \frac{\sigma_\mathrm{T}}{\sigma_\mathrm{C}(x)} \, \frac{3}{4}
    \left[ C^3(x, \theta) + C(x, \theta) -C^2(x, \theta)\sin^2\theta \right], \f]

    where \f$\theta\f$ is the scattering angle and \f$C(x, \theta)\f$ is the Compton factor defined
    earlier.

    <b>Sampling from the phase function</b>

    To draw a random scattering angle from the phase function, we use the algorithm described by
    Hua et al. 1997 (Computers in Physics 11, 660), which is a variation of the technique first
    suggested by Pei 1979 and often referred to as Khan's technique. A combination of composition
    and rejection methods, the algorithm avoids expensive operations and has a rejection rate of
    about 1/3 depending on the energy.

    Using our notation for the scaled energy \f$x\f$ of the incoming photon (see above), Hua et al.
    1997 define the doubled scaled incoming photon energy \f$\epsilon=2 x\f$ and the inverse
    Compton factor \f$r = 1 + x (1-\cos\theta)\f$. The sampling algorithm draws a random number for
    \f$r\f$, i.e. from the probability distribution for the inverse Compton factor at a given
    energy. The scattering angle can then easily be obtained from the definition of the inverse
    Compton factor. */
