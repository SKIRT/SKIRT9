/** An instance of the MappingsSEDFamily class represents the family of MAPPINGS III star-forming
    region template SEDs, parameterized on metallicity, compactness, ISM pressure and PDR covering
    factor, and scaled by star formation rate, as described by Groves et al. 2008 (ApJS,176,438).
    The model spectra have 1800 wavelength bins and cover 5 metallicities, 6 compactness
    parameters, 5 pressure values, and 2 covering factors (0 for pure HII and 1 for 100% PDR).

    The SEDs are tabulated over a wavelength range from 1 Angstrom to almost 1 meter
    with the spectral resolution shown in the figure below.

    The data were downloaded from http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/~brent/starburst.html ->
    Cparam_models.save, however it seems that this page/download is no longer available. The
    contents of the IDL save file were converted to SKIRT stored table format for inclusion as a
    resource file. The stored table is opened during setup, and it is subsequently interpolated to
    the desired parameters and wavelength grid when needed.

    When imported from a text column file, the properties of the star-forming region represented by
    this %SED family must appear in the following order, and have the specified default units
    unless these units are overridden by column header info:

    \f[ \dot{M}\,(\mathrm{M}_\odot\,{\text{yr}}^{-1}) \quad Z\,(\mathrm{dimless}) \quad \log
    C\,(\mathrm{dimless}) \quad p\,(\mathrm{Pa}) \quad f_{\text{PDR}}\,(\mathrm{dimless}) \f]

    where \f$\dot{M}\f$ is the star formation rate, assumed to be constant over the past 10 Myr,
    \f$Z\f$ is the metallicity, \f$\log C\f$ is the logarithm of the compactness, \f$p\f$ is the
    ISM pressure, and \f$f_{\text{PDR}}\f$ is the PDR covering factor. */
