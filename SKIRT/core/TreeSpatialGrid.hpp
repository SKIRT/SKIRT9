/** TreeSpatialGrid is an abstract subclass of the BoxSpatialGrid class, and represents
    three-dimensional spatial grids with cuboidal cells organized in a hierarchical tree. The
    tree's root node encloses the complete spatial domain, and nodes on subsequent levels
    recursively divide space into ever finer nodes. The depth of the tree can vary from place to
    place. The leaf nodes (those that are not further subdivided) are the actual spatial cells.

    The actual tree construction, including the choice of node type (a subclass of TreeNode) is
    delegated to each concrete subclass. This base class implements all other aspects required for
    using the grid, such as calculating paths traversing the grid. Depending on the type of
    TreeNode, the tree can become an octtree (8 children per node) or a binary tree (2 children per
    node). Other node types could be implemented, as long as they are cuboids lined up with the
    coordinate axes. */

    /** This function invokes the constructTree() function, to be implemented by a subclass,
        causing the tree to be constructed. The subclass returns a list of all created nodes back
        to the base class, and gives each node an identifier (ID) corresponding to its index in
        this list. Ownership of the nodes resides in the list passed back to the base class (not in
        the subclass, and not in the node hierarchy itself).

        After the subclass passes back the tree nodes, this function creates an extra vector that
        contains the node IDs of all leaf nodes, i.e. all nodes corresponding to the actual spatial
        cells. Conversely, the function also creates a vector with the cell indices of all the
        nodes, i.e. the rank \f$m\f$ of the node in the ID vector if the node is a leaf, and the
        number -1 if the node is not a leaf (and hence not a spatial cell). Finally, the function
        logs some details on the number of cells in the tree. */

    /** This function must be implemented in a subclass. It constructs the hierarchical tree and
        all (interconnected) nodes forming the tree. All nodes are instances of the same TreeNode
        subclass, selected by this function. The function returns a list of pointers to all created
        nodes (leaf and nonleaf). Ownership of the nodes resides in this returned list (not in the
        node hierarchy itself) and is thus handed to the caller.

        Each (leaf and nonleaf) node is given an identifier (ID) corresponding to its index in the
        list. The first node in the list is the root node of tree, i.e. the node encompasssing the
        complete spatial domain. Thus, by definition, the root node has an ID of zero.

        This function also causes the nodes to construct neighbor lists, interconnecting the nodes
        according to their spatial relationship. The neighbor lists are sorted so that the
        neighbors with the largest overlapping border area are listed first, increasing (on
        average) the probability of locating the correct neighbor early in the list. */

        For a tree grid, the function uses a rather straighforward algorithm. It determines the
        cell that contains the starting position, and calculates the first wall of the cell that
        will be crossed. The pathlength \f$\Delta s\f$ is determined and the current position is
        moved to a new position along this path, a tiny fraction further than \f$\Delta s\f$, \f[
        \begin{split} x_{\text{new}} &= x_{\text{current}} + (\Delta s + \epsilon)\,k_x \\

        10^{-12} \sqrt{x_{\text{max}}^2 + y_{\text{max}}^2 + z_{\text{max}}^2} \f] By adding this
        small extra bit, we ensure that the new position is now within the next cell, and we can
        repeat this exercise. This loop is terminated when the next position is outside the grid.

        To determine the cell index of the "next cell" in this algorithm, the function uses the
        neighbor lists constructed for each tree node during setup. */
