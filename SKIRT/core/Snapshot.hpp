/** Snapshot is an abstract base class for representing snapshot data that is imported from a
    column text file and is used to define the properties of primary sources or transfer media.
    This base class offers facilities to handle the input options, such as determining which
    columns are to be imported from the text file, and defines a common interface for all snapshot
    types, for example to obtain the density at a given position. The actual implementation must be
    provided in a derived class for each snapshot type.

    Some snapshot types use smoothed particles and some use spatial cells as their basic
    constituents. To avoid mentioning both, we use the generic term \em entity for referring to
    either particles or cells.

    A Snapshot instance must be initialized using the following strict calling sequence; calling
    any of the getters before the initialization sequence has completed results in undefined
    behavior:

      - open the input file by calling the open() function
      - configure the input file columns by calling the applicable importXXX() functions in the
        order the columns are expected to appear in the text file;
      - configure other options by calling the applicable setXXX() functions;
      - read the file calling the readAndClose() function.

    The functions for extracting information from a snapshot once it is loaded are thread-safe.
    However, the functions for configuring options and reading the snapshot file are \em not
    thread-safe; they must be called from a single thread (for each snapshot object). */
