/** An instance of the MediumState class contains the complete medium state for a simulation. The
    MediumSystem maintains a single (private) instance of this class and provides access to its
    contents to the rest of the simulation code as needed.

    For each spatial cell in the simulation, the medium state includes a set of \em common state
    variables shared by all medium components and a set of \em specific state variables for each
    individual medium component. The following table lists the variables that may be present in
    each of these sets.

    | Identifier | Symbol | Type | Set | Present
    | -----------|--------|------|-----|--------
    | Volume        | \f$V\f$      | double | Common   | always
    | BulkVelocity  | \f$v\f$      | Vec    | Common   | if needed for any medium component
    | MagneticField | \f$\bf{B}\f$ | Vec    | Common   | if needed for any medium component
    | NumberDensity | \f$n\f$      | double | Specific | always
    | Metallicity   | \f$Z\f$      | double | Specific | if requested by the medium component
    | Temperature   | \f$T\f$      | double | Specific | if requested by the medium component
    | Custom + k    |              | double | Specific | zero or more as requested by the medium component

    The presence or absence of these state variables is communicated to the MediumState class
    during its construction, so that it can dynamically allocate the appropriate amount of storage
    and provide an access mechanism for each state variable. This process is described in more
    detail in the following sections.

    <b>Construction</b>

    Fully initializing a MediumState object requires calling the following functions in the
    correct order (after default-constructing the object):
     - the initConfiguration() function specifies the number of spatial cells and the number of
       medium components in the simulation.
     - the initCommonStateVariables() function specifies the set of common state variables.
     - the initSpecificStateVariables() function must be called once for each medium component, in
       order of component index, specifying the set of specific state variables for that component.
     - the initAllocate() function finalizes construction and actually allocates storage.
     - the initCommunicate() function communicates the state variable values between processes.

    The initCommonStateVariables() and initSpecificStateVariables() functions each receive a list
    of StateVariable objects to identify the required state variables (only the identifier is used,
    the other information is ignored). All required state variables must be listed, including those
    that should always present. Variables of type Custom must be listed last. Multiple variables of
    type Custom can be requested by supplying indices in the range \f$ 0 \le k < K\f$, where K is
    the total number of custom variables. Each of these indices must occur in the list exactly once
    in increasing order.

    <b>Storage</b>

    To simplify the storage mechanism, state variables of type \c Vec are split into their three
    components, so that all state variables can considered to be of type \c double. Memory is
    allocated only for state variables that are actually needed. Given the number of spatial cells
    \f$M\f$, the number of medium components \f$H\f$, the number of common state variables \f$C\f$,
    and the number of specific state variables \f$S_h\f$ for each medium component \f$h\f$, the
    number of state variables per spatial cell is \f$K = C+\sum_h S_h\f$ and the grand total number
    of state variables is \f$N = M (C+\sum_h S_h)\f$.

    The MediumState class allocates a single one-dimensional data array of this size \f$N\f$ and
    provides a mapping to locate a particular state variable in this array. This is accomplished by
    also storing the offset for each variable within the set of variables per spatial cell. To
    facilitate access, these offsets are stored for all supported variables (by name) and not just
    for the required variables. The offsets for unused variables remain at zero.

    Given the offset \f$O_x\f$ for a particular state variable \f$x\f$, a spatial cell index
    \f$m\f$ and a medium component index \f$h\f$, the index of the variable in the data array can
    be calculated as \f$i=K \times m + O_x\f$ (storing contiguously per cell) or \f$i=M \times O_x
    + m\f$ (storing contiguously per variable). We can evaluate the performance of these and
    possibly other mapping schemes.

    <b>Access to undefined variables</b>

    In general, an attempt to access (read or write) a variable for which storage has not been
    requested results in undefined behavior. However, assuming that storage has been requested for
    the volume (which is always needed anyway), the other variables in the common state can be
    safely read (not written) even if no storage was requested for them. This allows the bulk
    velocity and magnetic field vectors to be retrieved without concern for whether they were
    configured in the input model. */

        passed to the initConfiguration() function, where each element in the vector corresponds to
        the cell with the same index. If the calling process updated the state of a given cell, the
        corresponding vector element must be \em UpdatedConverged or \em UpdatedNotConverged and
        otherwise it must be \em NotUpdated. The function returns a pair of integers specifying the
        total number of updated cells and the total number of not-converged cells, aggregated over
        all processes.

        Only one of the calling processes may have updated the state for any given cell. If two or
