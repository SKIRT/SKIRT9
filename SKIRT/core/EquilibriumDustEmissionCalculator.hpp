/** EquilibriumDustEmissionCalculator is a helper class to calculate the equilibrium temperature
    \f$T_{\text{eq}}\f$ and the emissivity spectrum \f$\varepsilon_{\lambda}\f$ of representative
    dust grain populations embedded in a given radiation field \f$J_\lambda\f$.

    The class is equipped to handle multiple (in principle independent) representative grains.
    These are called \em bins because the calculator is typically used to handle the various grain
    size bins in a dust mix. Indeed, the equilibrium temperature and the emissivity spectrum are
    nonlinear functions of the grain properties, and thus a single representative grain cannot
    usually accurately represent a dust mix.

    A client of the class must first call the precalculate() function for each bin (in order of bin
    index \f$b\f$) to supply the absorption cross sections for the representative grain population
    corresponding to that bin. The equilibriumTemperature() function can then be used to obtain the
    equilibrium temperature for a given bin, and the emissivity() function can be used to obtain
    the combined emissivity spectrum for the representative grains in all bins. In both cases, the
    embedding radiation field is specified by the mean intensities \f$(J_\lambda)_k\f$, which must
    be discretized on the simulation's radiation field wavelength grid as returned by the
    Configuration::radiationFieldWLG() function. The emissivity spectrum
    \f$(\varepsilon_\lambda)_\ell\f$ produced by the second function is discretized on the
    wavelength grid returned by the Configuration::dustEmissionWLG() function.

    The equilibrium temperature \f$T_{\text{eq},b}\f$ for bin with index \f$b\f$ is obtained from
    the energy balance equation, \f[ \int_0^\infty \varsigma_{\lambda,b}^{\text{abs}}\, J_\lambda\,
    {\text{d}}\lambda = \int_0^\infty \varsigma_{\lambda,b}^{\text{abs}}\,
    B_\lambda(T_{\text{eq},b})\, {\text{d}}\lambda \f] where \f$B_\lambda(T)\f$ is the Planck
    function. The left-hand side is integrated over the radiation field wavelength grid, and the
    right-hand side is precalculated for a range of temperatures through integration over the
    wavelength grid and cross sections passed to the precalculate() function. If the simulation's
    configuration requests the inclusion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as an additional
    source for dust heating, the corresponding term is added to the left-hand side of the energy
    balance equation: \f[ \int_0^\infty \varsigma_{\lambda,b}^{\text{abs}}\, \left[
    B_\lambda\left((1+z) T_\mathrm{CMB}^{z=0}\right) + J_\lambda\right] \, {\text{d}}\lambda =
    \int_0^\infty \varsigma_{\lambda,b}^{\text{abs}}\, B_\lambda(T_{\text{eq},b})\,
    {\text{d}}\lambda \f] where \f$z\f$ is the redshift at which the simulated model resides and
    \f$T_\mathrm{CMB}^{z=0} = 2.725\,\mathrm{K}\f$.

    The equilibrium emissivity spectrum of all bins combined embedded in a radiation field
    \f$J_\lambda\f$ can then be written as \f[ \varepsilon_\lambda = \sum_{b=0}^{N_{\text{bins}}-1}
    \varsigma_{\lambda,b}^{\text{abs}}\, B_\lambda(T_{\text{eq},b}) \f] with
    \f$\varsigma_{\lambda,b}^{\text{abs}}\f$ the absorption cross section of the \f$b\f$'th
    representative grain and \f$T_{\text{eq},b}\f$ the equilibrium temperature of that grain. */
