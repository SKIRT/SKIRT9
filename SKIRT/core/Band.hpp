/** An instance of a Band subclass represents the transmission curve of a particular observational
    filter as a function of wavelength. Examples include the standard Johnson filters and the
    transmission curves in each broadband for actual observatories such as GALEX, SDSS or Herschel.

    This abstract base class implements the key operations offered by all Band objects: obtaining
    the transmission at a given wavelength, calculating the mean specific luminosity for a given
    %SED after convolving it with the transmission curve, and determining the pivot wavelength.
    Subclasses are responsible only for acquiring and serving the data points defining the
    transmission curve for the band.

    Refer to the appendix in Camps et al. 2016 (MNRAS 462, 1057-1075) for a brief introduction of
    the relevant concepts and a derivation of the corresponding formulas. For the purposes of this
    class, a band is defined through its arbitrarily scaled transmission curve \f$T(\lambda)\f$.
    The relative transmission at a given wavelength can then be written as \f[
    T_\text{rel}(\lambda) = \frac{ T(\lambda) } { \max[ T(\lambda) ] }. \f]

    Given a spectral energy distribution \f$L_\lambda(\lambda)\f$, the mean specific luminosity
    over the band \f$\left<L_\lambda\right>\f$ can then be obtained through \f[
    \left<L_\lambda\right> = \frac{ \int L_\lambda(\lambda)T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda } { \int
    T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda }. \f]

    The pivot wavelength of the band is defined as the wavelength at which the mean specific
    luminosity can be properly converted between wavelength and frequency representations. It is
    given by \f[ \lambda_\mathrm{pivot} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \int T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda } {
    \int T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda/\lambda^2 } }. \f]

    The effective width of the band is defined as the horizontal size of a rectangle with height
    equal to the maximum transmission and with the same area as the one covered by the band's
    transmission curve. It is given by \f[ W_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{ \int T(\lambda)
    \,\mathrm{d}\lambda } { \max[ T(\lambda) ] }. \f]

    As set forth by Camps et al. 2016, for energy measuring devices (bolometers) the total system
    transmission \f$T(\lambda)\f$ is usually given by the instrument designers, and it can be used
    directly for this class. For photon counters (including all instruments in the UV, optical and
    near infrared), the total system response \f$R(\lambda)\f$ is usually given instead. The
    transmission curve needed for this class can be derived from the response curve through \f[
    T(\lambda) = \lambda\,R(\lambda). \f] This operation must be performed in a preprocessing step
    before handing the data to this class.

    Also, to further simplify the above formulas, this class requires that the transmission curve
    provided by a subclass is normalized to unity, i.e. \f[ \int T(\lambda) \,\mathrm{d}\lambda =
    1. \f] */
