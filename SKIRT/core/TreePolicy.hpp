/** TreePolicy is an abstract class that represents the configurable options and the corresponding
    implementation mechanisms for constructing spatial tree grids, as a service to the
    PolicyTreeSpatialGrid class. Encapsulating these policies in a separate class hierarchy allows
    offering and possibly combining different policies without complicating the TreeSpatialGrid
    class hierarchy.

    The public interface of TreePolicy class offers just a single function that is invoked by the
    PolicyTreeSpatialGrid class during setup to construct the tree hierarchy and all TreeNode
    instances in it. */

        subclass as the root node passed as an argument. The function returns a list of pointers to
        all created nodes (leaf and nonleaf). Ownership of the nodes resides in this returned list
        (not in the node hierarchy itself) and is thus handed to the caller.

        Each (leaf and nonleaf) node is given an identifier (ID) corresponding to its index in the
        list. The first node in the list is the root node of tree, i.e. the node passed as an
        argument. By definition, the root node has an ID of zero.

        This function also causes the nodes to construct neighbor lists, interconnecting the nodes
        according to their spatial relationship. The neighbor lists are sorted so that the
        neighbors with the largest overlapping border area are listed first, increasing (on
        average) the probability of locating the correct neighbor early in the list. */
