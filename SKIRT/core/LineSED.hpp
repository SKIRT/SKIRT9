/** LineSED is an abstract class for representing spectral energy distributions that consist of one
    or more discrete emission lines with zero width. Mathematically, the specific luminosity is
    infinite at the line wavelengths and zero everywhere else, while the integrated luminosity
    (over all lines in the source wavelength range) is still normalized to unity. As a result, the
    specific luminosity is numerically undefined. This imposes important restrictions on the use of the %SED:

    - A LineSED must be normalized by defining the integrated luminosity over a wavelength range
    that includes one or more of the line wavelengths. It \em cannot be normalized by defining the
    specific luminosity at a given wavelength or for a broadband.

    - The wavelength bias property of the corresponding source must be set to zero, because the
    mechanism for wavelength biasing relies on the specific luminosity.

    The subclass must provide the list of wavelengths and corresponding relative luminosities, and
    this abstract class handles everything else. */
