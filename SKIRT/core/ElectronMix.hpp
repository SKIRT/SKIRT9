/** The ElectronMix class describes the material properties for a population of electrons.
    Electrons do not absorb photons. They do, however, significantly scatter photons. This process
    is described by Compton scattering, which converges to Thomson scattering at low photon
    energies. It is meaningful to implement both processes, because the calculations for Compton
    scattering are substantially slower than those for Thomson scattering.

    <b>Compton and Thomson scattering</b>

    For wavelengths shorter than 10 nm, this class models Compton scattering, which features a
    wavelength-dependent cross section and phase function, and which causes the photon energy
    (wavelength) to change during the interaction. This process is implemented through the
    ComptonPhaseFunction class; see that class for more information. The current implementation of
    Compton scattering does not support polarization.

    For wavelengths longer than 10nm, the scattering process can be described by elastic and
    wavelength-independent Thomson scattering. The scattering cross section is given by the
    well-known Thomson cross section (a constant) and the phase function is that of a dipole.
    Consequently, this class calls on the DipolePhaseFunction class to implement Thomson
    scattering; see that class for more information. In this wavelength regime, polarization is
    fully supported (if enabled by the user).

    The transition point between Compton and Thomson scattering can be justified as follows. For
    wavelengths much longer than 10 nm, the expression for the Compton cross section becomes
    numerically unstable. This could be solved by using a series expansion approximation at longer
    wavelengths. However, at a wavelength of 10 nm, the Compton cross section has approached the
    Thomson constant to within less than 0.05 per cent. It thus seems reasonable to transition to
    the much faster Thomson scattering at that wavelength point.

    <b>Thermal dispersion</b>

    By default, this class assumes that all electrons are at rest in the local frame (i.e., there
    is no movement other than the bulk velocity of the spatial cell containing the electrons). If
    the \em includeThermalDispersion configuration flag is enabled (and the simulation mode is
    panchromatic), a random thermal motion corresponding to the local temperature is added when
    performing a scattering interaction. The dispersion is not taken into account to determine the
    scattering cross section, because that value does not vary significantly for small wavelength
    shifts (and it does not vary at all for Thomson scattering).

    If the electron mix is associated with an ImportedMedium and the \em importTemperature flag for
    the medium is enabled, the local dispersion temperature is obtained from the imported file.
    Otherwise, the value configured for the \em defaultTemperature property is used instead,
    resulting in a constant temperature across space. */
