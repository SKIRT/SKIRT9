/** The ElectronMix class describes the material properties for a population of electrons.
    Electrons do not absorb photons. They do, however, significantly scatter photons. This process
    is described by Compton scattering, which converges to Thomson scattering at low photon
    energies. It is meaningful to implement both processes, because the calculations for Compton
    scattering are substantially slower than those for Thomson scattering.

    Specifically, for wavelengths shorter than 10 nm, this class models Compton scattering, which
    features a wavelength-dependent cross section and phase function, and which causes the photon
    energy (wavelength) to change during the interaction. This process is implemented through the
    ComptonPhaseFunction class; see that class for more information. The current implementation of
    Compton scattering does not support polarization.

    For wavelengths longer than 10nm, the scattering process can be described by elastic and
    wavelength-independent Thomson scattering. The scattering cross section is given by the
    well-known Thomson cross section (a constant) and the phase function is that of a dipole.
    Consequently, this class calls on the DipolePhaseFunction class to implement Thomson
    scattering; see that class for more information. In this wavelength regime, polarization is
    fully supported (if enabled by the user).

    The transition point between Compton and Thomson scattering can be justified as follows. At a
    wavelength of 10 nm, the Compton cross section has approached the Thomson constant to within
    less than 0.05 per cent. At the same time, for wavelengths much longer than 10 nm, the
    expression for the Compton cross section becomes numerically unstable. Switching to Thomson
    scattering for longer wavelengths is thus important for accuracy in addition to performance.

    The current implementation of this class assumes that all electrons are at rest in the local
    bulk velocity frame (i.e they all move exactly at the local bulk velocity). */
