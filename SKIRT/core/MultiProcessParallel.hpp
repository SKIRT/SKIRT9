/** This class implements the Parallel base class interface using a single execution thread in each
    of multiple processes. In the root process, the class in fact employs a second thread to
    perform the actual work, so that the parent thread can serve chunk requests to the other
    processes (the MPI functions should be called only from the main thread). This extra thread is
    not counted towards the number of threads specified by the user because it does not consume
    significant resources. In the other (non-root) processes, there is no extra thread; the work is
    performed in a loop that simply requests and performs new chunks.

    This class uses the facilities offered by the MultiParallel base class. */
