/** SiteListTreePolicy represents the configurable options and the corresponding implementation
    mechanisms for constructing spatial tree grids based on the positions of particles, sites or
    cells in an imported medium distribution. The policy locates a site list offered by one of the
    media components in the medium system. See the ImportedMedium class and the various Snapshot
    subclasses for more information on the site positions returned by imported media. If multiple
    media offer a site list, the first one in configuration order (i.e. ski file order) is used.

    In a first step the tree is subdivided in such a way that each leaf node contains at most one
    of the sites in the list. Subsequently each of these leaf nodes is further subdivided a fixed
    number of times, as configured by the user. However, the minimum and maximum tree subdvision
    levels (actually offered by the base class) override the other subdvision criteria described
    above. Tree nodes are always subdivided up to the minimum level, and nodes are never subdivided
    beyond the maximum level. */
