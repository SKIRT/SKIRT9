/** The FilePaths class manages the paths for the input and output files of a simulation, and for
    the resources included with the code or provided externally.

    <b>Input and output files</b>

    A client program determines the input and output file paths and the prefix for output file
    names, presumably from the command line options. It then stores this information in the
    FilePaths instance held by the simulation, so that the simulation hierarchy can easily access
    it.

    <b>Resource files</b>

    The FilePaths class also offers static functions for locating the resource files used by the
    simulation hierarchy. These files can be provided as part of the build tree in the source code
    repository, or can be installed in a directory next to (and thus outside of) the build tree.
    This mechanism allows to provide small and frequently-used resource files as part of the source
    code repository, while requiring larger resource files to be downloaded seperately.

    Resource files are identified by their filename, without any directory or path information. In
    other words, a given resource file could be located in any of the supported directories (or
    nested subdirectory). On the other hand, this means there can be only a single resource with a
    particular name.

    Specifically, when first invoked, the FilePaths class builds a list of all available resource
    files by iterating over the following directories and all nested subdirectories inside these
    directories, recursively:

    - the \c resources directory inside the SKIRT build tree.

    - the \c resources directory (if any) next to the SKIRT \c git directory (i.e. outside of the
    build tree).

    The top-level directories are iterated in the order listed above. The iteration order for the
    nested subdirectories inside the top-level directories is unspecified. The first occurrence of
    a particular filename is stored; any subsequent occurrences of the same filename are ignored.

    <b>Resource packs</b>

    Finally, the FilePaths class offers static functions that support versioning for resource \em
    packs, which are usually installed in the resource directory outside of the build tree.

    A resource pack is a set of resource files contained in a resource subdirectory, called the
    pack directory, that contains a file named \c version.txt. The first token in this text file's
    contents is interpreted as the integer version number of the resource pack. The name of the
    resource pack is determined by the segment of the pack directory name after the last
    underscore. The resource files in the pack can reside in nested subdirectories.

    Furthermore, a resource file named \c ExpectedResources.txt can be provided as part of the
    build tree. This text file lists the names and version numbers of the resource packs expected
    to be installed, one pack name and corresponding version number per line.

    The FilePaths class offers functions to retrieve information on the expected and installed
    resource packs from these files. This information can be used by the client program to verify
    that the appropriate resource pack versions have been installed.
