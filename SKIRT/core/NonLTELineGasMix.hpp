/** The NonLTELineGasMix class describes the material properties related to selected transitions in
    selected molecules and atoms. For each supported species, the current implementation includes a
    number of rotational energy levels (quantum number \f$J\f$) at the base vibrational level
    (quantum number \f$v=0\f$) for molecules and electronic energy levels and hyperfine split
    levels for atoms, and supports the allowed transitions between these levels. Vibrational energy
    levels and the corresponding rovibrational transitions may be added later. The class properties
    allow configuring the species and the number of transitions to be considered.

    For each supported transition, the emission luminosity and absorption opacity in a given cell
    are determined from the gas properties defined in the input model and the local radiation field
    calculated by the simulation. The class performs an iterative, non-LTE calculation including
    the effects of collisional transitions (excitation and de-excitation with one or more types of
    interaction partners) and photonic transitions (spontaneous emission, absorption, and induced
    emission). This allows establishing the energy level distribution (population) for a wide range
    of material densities and radiation fields.

    <b>Supported species and transitions</b>

    The current implementation supports the following molecular or atomic species:

    - \c Two-level test molecule (TT): a fictive test molecule (called TT for our purposes) that
    has just two rotational energy levels with a corresponding transition line at 1666.67
    \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The single collisional interaction partner is molecular hydrogen. The
    properties of this molecule are defined by van Zadelhoff et al. 2002 for use with the first
    benchmark problem described there.

    - \c Hydroxyl radical (OH): includes rotational energy levels up to \f$J=7/2\f$ including
    hyperfine splitted levels. The corresponding transition lines are at wavelengths from 24.6
    \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$ to 2 \f$\mathrm{m}\f$. The single collisional interaction partner is
    molecular hydrogen.

    - \c Formyl cation (HCO+): includes rotational energy levels up to \f$J=29\f$. The
    corresponding transition lines are at wavelengths from 112.4 to 3361 \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The
    single collisional interaction partner is molecular hydrogen.

    - \c Carbon monoxide (CO): includes rotational energy levels up to \f$J=40\f$. The
    corresponding transition lines are at wavelengths from 65.7 to 2601 \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The
    single collisional interaction partner is molecular hydrogen.

    - \c Atomic carbon (C): includes three hyperfine split levels at the electronic ground level of
    3P. The corresponding transition lines are at wavelengths 230.3, 370.4 and 609.1
    \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The collisional interaction partners include molecular hydrogen, neutral
    atomic hydrogen, ionized atomic hydrogen, electrons, and Helium.

    - \c Ionized carbon (C+): includes four electronic levels (2p, 4p, 2D, and 2S) and the
    hyperfine split levels in the electronic levels of 2p and 4p. The corresponding fine-structure
    transition lines for levels 2p and 4p are at wavelengths 157.74, 198.9, 353.57, 454.67
    \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The electronic transition lines are at wavelengths from 0.1 to 0.23
    \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The collisional interaction partners include molecular hydrogen, neutral
    atomic hydrogen, and electrons.

    <b>Configuring the simulation</b>

    Simulations that include gas represented by the NonLTELineGasMix often also include dust,
    although this is not a requirement. In any case, the simulation must have one or more primary
    sources that trigger the molecular lines directly (e.g. the cosmic microwave background) or
    indirectly (e.g. by heating the dust and thus causing thermal dust emission), or both. The \em
    simulationMode should be set to "GasEmission" or "DustAndGasEmission" correspondingly.

    Because the secondary emission and the radiation field are calculated self-consistently, \em
    iterateSecondaryEmission should always be enabled. If the wavelength range of the primary
    source(s) significantly overlaps the emission lines of the species under consideration (in
    other words, if the opacity at the line wavelengths significantly affects the primary radiation
    field), then \em includePrimaryEmission in IterationOptions must be enabled as well. If not,
    this property can be left disabled. In both cases, \em iteratePrimaryEmission can be left
    disabled unless iteration is required for other media (for example, to self-consistently
    calculate radiative dust destruction).

    The radiation field wavelength grid should properly resolve the UV, optical, and infrared
    wavelength range (in case the simulation includes dust) and the wavelength ranges of the
    supported transition lines. Separate instruments can be configured for the relevant wavelength
    ranges, e.g. using a logarithmic grid for the continuum spectrum and linear grids for the line
    profiles.

    During the initial primary emission segment, the simulation determines the radiation field
    resulting from the primary sources, dust attenuation (if present) and molecular line absorption
    based on default equilibrium level populations. The resulting radiation field allows a first
    estimation of the level populations for each spatial grid cell; this calculation happens in the
    updateSpecificState() function.

    During secondary emission, the simulation takes into account emission from all configured media
    in addition to absorption by these same media, including molecular lines in both cases. The
    previously stored level populations allow calculating the line emission spectrum and the line
    absorption cross sections. This results in an updated radiation field, which will in turn
    influence the level populations (and for high optical depths, possibly the dust temperature),
    which in turn influences the secondary emission spectra. In order to obtain a self-consistent
    result, the simulation must therefore iterate over secondary emission.

    The input model must provide values for the spatial distribution of several medium properties,
    including the number density of the species under consideration, the number density of any
    relevant collisional partner species, the kinetic gas temperature, and the turbulence velocity.
    These values remain constant during the simulation. Most often, this information will be read
    from an input file by associating the NonLTELineGasMix with a subclass of ImportedMedium.
    For that medium component, the ski file attribute \em importTemperature <b>must</b> be set to
    'true', and \em importMetallicity and \em importVariableMixParams must be left at 'false'. The
    additional columns required by the material mix are automatically imported and are expected
    <b>after</b> all other columns. For example, if bulk velocities are also imported for this
    medium component (i.e. \em importVelocity is 'true'), the column order would be \f[ ...,
    n_\mathrm{mol}, T_\mathrm{kin}, v_\mathrm{x}, v_\mathrm{y}, v_\mathrm{z}, n_\mathrm{col1} [,
    n_\mathrm{col1}, ...], v_\mathrm{turb}\f]

    For basic testing purposes, the NonLTELineGasMix can also be associated with a geometric
    medium component. The geometry then defines the spatial density distribution of the species
    under consideration (i.e. \f$n_\mathrm{mol}\f$), and the NonLTELineGasMix configuration
    properties specify a fixed default value for the other properties that will be used across the
    spatial domain. In this case, the number densities of the collisional partners are defined by a
    constant multiplier relative to \f$n_\mathrm{mol}\f$.

    <b>Thermal motion and turbulence</b>

    The thermal velocity in a medium of particles with mass \f$m\f$ at temperature
    \f$T_\mathrm{kin}\f$ is defined as \f[ v_\mathrm{th} = \sqrt{\frac{2kT_\mathrm{kin}}{m}}. \f]
    This value corresponds to the most probable particle speed, i.e. the point where the
    probability distribution of the velocity vector norm reaches its maximum value. One often
    considers an additional source of line broadening caused by subgrid processes other than those
    corresponding to the kinetic temperature. This motion is characterized by the turbulent
    velocity \f$v_\mathrm{turb}\f$. Assuming a Gaussian line profile, the total velocity dispersion
    \f$v_\mathrm{s}\f$ (the standard deviation of the Gaussian in velocity space) is then defined
    through \f[ \sqrt{2}\,v_\mathrm{s} = \sqrt{v_\mathrm{th}^2 + v_\mathrm{turb}^2}. \f] We can
    artificially combine the effect of both thermal motion and turbulence into an effective
    temperature, \f[ T_\mathrm{eff} = T_\mathrm{kin} + \frac{m v_\mathrm{turb}^2}{2k}. \f]

    <b>Level populations</b>

    We denote the populations for the \f$N\f$ supported energy levels as \f$n_i\f$, with indices
    \f$i=0,N-1\f$ increasing from lowest to highest energy state, and with \f$\sum_i n_i =
    n_\mathrm{mol}\f$. The level populations form the basis to calculate the emission luminosities
    and the absorption opacities at later stage. Their values are obtained by solving the set of
    statistical equilibrium equations given by

    \f[ \sum_{j>i} \Big[n_jA_{ji} + (n_jB_{ji} - n_iB_{ij})J_{\lambda,ji})\Big]
    - \sum_{j<i} \Big[n_iA_{ij} + (n_iB_{ij} - n_jB_{ji})J_{\lambda,ij})\Big]
    + \sum_{j\neq i} \Big[n_jC_{ji} - n_iC_{ij}\Big]=0, \quad i=0,N-1\f]

    where \f$J_{\lambda,ul}\f$ is the mean radiation field intensity integrated over the line
    profile corresponding to the transition from upper energy level \f$u\f$ to lower energy level
    \f$l\f$. Furthermore, \f$A_{ul}\f$, \f$B_{ul}\f$, \f$B_{lu}\f$ are the Einstein coefficients
    for spontaneous emission, induced emission, and absorption, and \f$C_{ul}\f$, \f$C_{lu}\f$ the
    coefficients for collisional excitation and de-excitation. These coefficients are taken from
    the literature.

    The Einstein coefficients \f$A_{ul}\f$, \f$B_{ul}\f$, and \f$B_{lu}\f$ are constant for each
    transition, and the \f$B_{ul}\f$ and \f$B_{lu}\f$ coefficients can be obtained from the
    \f$A_{ul}\f$ coefficients through \f[ B_{ul} = \frac{\lambda_{ul}^5}{2 hc^2}A_{ul} \f] and \f[
    B_{lu} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} B_{ul} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \frac{\lambda_{ul}^5}{2 hc^2}A_{ul}, \f]
    where \f$g_u\f$ and \f$g_l\f$ represent the degeneracy of the upper and lower energy levels,
    respectively. The collisional coefficients \f$C_{ul}\f$ and \f$C_{lu}\f$ depend on the number
    density of the collisional partner and on the kinetic temperature \f$T_\mathrm{kin}\f$ of the
    gas. These coefficients are related by \f[ \frac{C_{lu}}{C_{ul}} = \frac{g_u}{g_l}
    \exp(-E_{ul}/kT_\mathrm{kin}).\f]

    <b>Emission</b>

    The integrated line luminosity \f$L_{ul}\f$ corresponding to the transition from upper energy
    level \f$u\f$ to lower energy level \f$l\f$ for a given spatial cell is given by

    \f[ L_{ul} = \frac{hc}{\lambda_{ul}} A_{ul} n_u V_\mathrm{cell}, \f]

    where \f$\lambda_{ul}\f$ is the transition wavelength and \f$V_\mathrm{cell}\f$ is the volume
    of the cell. The SKIRT framework automatically adds a Gaussian line profile assuming a thermal
    velocity corresponding to the effective temperature in the cell and the mass of a molecule, in
    addition to any Doppler shifts caused by the bulk velocity in the cell.

    <b>Absorption</b>

    The absorption opacity \f$k^\text{abs}(\lambda)\f$ as a function of wavelength \f$\lambda\f$ is
    given by

    \f[ k^\text{abs}(\lambda) = \sum_{ul} \, \frac{h c}{4\pi \lambda_{ul}}
    (n_l\,B_{lu}-n_u\,B_{ul}) \,\phi_{ul}(\lambda) \f]

    where the sum runs over all supported transitions, \f$u\f$ and \f$l\f$ are the indices of the
    energy levels before and after the transition, and \f$\phi_{ul}(\lambda)\f$ is the Gaussian
    profile of the line corresponding to the transition.

    The calculation explicitly includes the Gaussian line profile caused by thermal motion of the
    molecules in the local bulk velocity frame of the cell. Moreover, the absorption profiles of
    all supported lines are superposed on top of each other. In practice, the implementation
    includes just the terms that have a significant contribution at any given wavelength.

    <b>Limiting negative optical depth</b>

    The formula for the absorption opacity given in the previous section yields a negative value in
    case the medium exhibits stimulated emission. The explicit absorption technique (see the
    MonteCarloSimulation class) supports the corresponding negative optical depths along a photon
    path. However, numerical problems arise if the negative optical depth magnitude becomes too
    high. This may happen, for example, as a result of Monte Carlo noise, or in the early stages
    when a simulation has not yet converged.

    Therefore, this class imposes a user-configurable lower limit on the (negative) optical depth
    along a cell diagonal before returning an absorption opacity. The default limit is -2.

    <b>Storing mean intensities</b>

    As discussed above, the mean radiation field intensity \f$J_{\lambda,ul}\f$ is determined for
    each transition line as a prerequisite for calculating the level populations in a given cell.
    These values are obtained by integrating the radiation field, as discretized on the
    simulation's radiation field wavelength grid, over the appropriate Gaussian line profile. There
    is no need to keep these values around for the regular operation of the code. However, they can
    form a relevant diagnostic to assess the level of Monte Carlo noise in the simulation or to
    evaluate iterative convergence. Therefore, if the \em storeMeanIntensities flag is turned on,
    the mean radiation field intensity at each transition line is stored in the medium state for
    each cell, so that the information can be probed using the CustomStateProbe class.

    <b>Providing initial level populations</b>

    By default, the level populations are initialized in each cell using a Boltzmann distribution
    as a function of temperature (i.e., assuming LTE conditions). This may be far from the correct
    non-LTE levels, possibly requiring many iterations to obtain a properly converged solution. It
    might therefore be meaningful to provide customized initial conditions. If the \em
    initialLevelPopsFilename string is nonempty, it specifies the name of a text column file with a
    column for each energy level and a row for each spatial cell in the simulation. Specifically,
    the first column lists a cell index that is ignored, and remaining columns list the relative
    population for each energy level in units of number density (the values are scaled to the total
    number density in the cell, so the specific units don't really matter). The rows must exactly
    match the number and ordering of the cells in the simulation's spatial grid (see below).

    This input format is designed such that the text file can easily be produced by a
    CustomStateProbe instance in a previous simulation. For example, assuming 9 energy levels, one
    could configure a probe as follows:

        <CustomStateProbe probeName="populations" indices="2-10" probeAfter="Run">
            <form type="Form">
                <PerCellForm/>
            </form>
        </CustomStateProbe>

    The requirement to have an identical spatial grid in both simulations is easily met for 1D, 2D
    and 3D grids with a regular mesh in each spatial direction. For octree and binary tree grids
    the precise cell hierarchy is usually determined based on random samples of the medium density
    distribution, resulting in a slightly different structure for each run. To work around this
    problem, one needs to output the topology of the hierarchical grid in the first simulation
    using a TreeSpatialGridTopologyProbe instance, and load this topology in subsequent simulations
    using a FileTreeSpatialGrid instance.
