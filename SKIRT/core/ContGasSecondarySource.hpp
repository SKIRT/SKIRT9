        abstract EmittingGasMix class. Before the constructor returns, the newly created object is

        spatial cell of the simulation, and returns the total bolometric luminosity. */

        history indices allocated to this source. */

    /** This function causes the photon packet \em pp to be launched from one of the cells in the
        spatial grid using the given history index. Because photon packets launched from a given
        spatial cell are usually handled consecutively by the same execution thread, this function
        can and does calculate the emission spectrum for a given cell only once. It preserves the
        relevant information from one invocation of the function to the next in a helper object
        allocated with thread-local storage scope. As a result, memory requirements are limited to
        storing the information for only a single cell per execution thread, and the calculation is
        still performed only once per cell.

        Once the emission spectrum for the current cell is known, the function randomly generates a
        wavelength either from this emission spectrum or from the configured bias wavelength
        distribution, adjusting the launch weight with the proper bias factor. It then generates a
        random position uniformly within the spatial cell. The function obtains the bulk velocity
        of the cell for application of the appropriate macroscopic Doppler shift; other than this
        the emission is assumed to be unpolarized and isotropic in the comoving frame.

        Finally, the function actually initializes the photon packet with this information. */
