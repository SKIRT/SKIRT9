/** A ParticleGeometry instance represents a 3D geometry with a spatial density distribution
    described by a list of smoothed particles. The particle data is usually extracted from a
    cosmological simulation snapshot, and it must be provided in a column text file formatted as
    described below. The total mass in the geometry is normalized to unity after importing the
    data.

    Refer to the description of the TextInFile class for information on overall formatting and on
    how to include header lines specifying the units for each column in the input file. In case the
    input file has no unit specifications, the default units mentioned below are used instead. The
    input file should contain 5, 6, or 7 columns, depending on the options configured by the user
    for this ParticleGeometry instance:

    \f[ x\,(\mathrm{pc}) \quad y\,(\mathrm{pc}) \quad z\,(\mathrm{pc}) \quad h\,(\mathrm{pc}) \quad
    M\,(\mathrm{M}_\odot) \quad [Z\,(1)] \quad [T\,(\mathrm{K})] \f]

    The first three columns are the \f$x\f$, \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ coordinates of the particle, the
    fourth column is the particle smoothing length \f$h\f$, and the fifth column is the mass
    \f$M\f$ of the particle. The mass units are actually irrelevant because the total mass in the
    geometry will be normalized to unity after importing the data. However, the import procedure
    still insists on knowing the units.

    If the \em importMetallicity option is enabled, the next column specifies a "metallicity"
    fraction, which in this context is simply multiplied with the mass column to obtain the actual
    mass of the particle. If the \em importTemperature option is enabled, the next column specifies
    a temperature. If this temperature is higher than the maximum configured temperature, the
    particle is ignored. If the \em importTemperature option is disabled, or the maximum
    temperature value is set to zero, the particle is never ignored. */
