/** ImportedSource is an abstract class representing a primary radiation source with a spatial and
    spectral luminosity distribution imported from an input file. The input data is usually derived
    from a hydrodynamical simulation snapshot. Various types of snapshots are supported by
    subclasses of this class. Refer to the subclass documentation for information on the file
    format.

    Usually, the input file defines a spatial distribution through smoothed particles, which must
    be interpolated and summed, or through adjacent cells that partition the spatial domain. At the
    level of this abstract class, we use the generic term \em entity for referring to either a
    particle or a cell.

    In addition to spatial information, each entity in the snapshot carries properties that allow
    selecting a particular %SED from a parameterized %SED family. The present class requires the
    user to configure an SEDFamily object for this purpose. The number, type, and order of
    parameters is defined by the %SED family. For each entity, the %SED family is requested to
    select and properly scale a specific %SED based on the entity's properties. Combining the
    spatial and spectral information for an entity yields its contribution to the imported
    radiation source.

    The input file may include a separate column listing the current mass. When this option is
    enabled, the provided current mass can be used for probing the input model. This is relevant
    because %SED families usually do not request the current mass as a parameter (they often use
    the initial mass instead, or do not include direct mass information at all).

    The input file may also include a bulk velocity vector with an optional velocity dispersion for
    each entity. When this option is enabled, the appropriate Doppler shift is taken into account
    when launching photon packets. Apart from the anisotropy resulting from this optional Doppler
    shift, the radiation emitted by this primary source is always isotropic. It is also always
    unpolarized. */

         the map constructed by the prepareForLaunch() function. It obtains the normalized spectral
         distribition (and the corresponding cumulative distribution) for that entity from the SED
         family configured for this source. In fact, the function sets up a thread-local object
         that caches the spectral distribution for an entity between consecutive invocations of the
         launch() function. This works even if there are multiple sources of this type because each
         thread handles a single photon packet at a time.

         Subsequently, the function samples a wavelength from the entity's SED, properly handling
         the configured wavelength biasing, and asks the Snapshot object to generate a random
         launch position for the entity. If the importVelocity flag is enabled, the function also
         constructs an object that serves a RedshiftInterface appropriate for the velocity of the
         entity. Again, this object is allocated in thread-local storage so that it stays around
         after being handed to the photon packet.

         Finally, the function causes the photon packet to be launched with the information
         described above and an isotropic launch direction. */
