/** Medium is an abstract class representing a radiation transfer medium in the simulation. The
    configuration for a simulation may include multiple, spatially superimposed, transfer media.
    Each medium (an instance of a Medium subclass) must define the following information at each
    point in the spatial domain of the medium (which may differ from the size of the spatial grid
    in the simulation):
      - The material type and the optical material properties at a given wavelength.
      - Depending on the material type, the properties required to calculate medium state and
        secondary emission (for dust, calorimetric properties; for gas, kinetic temperature).
      - The number density and mass density of the material (implying a total number and mass).
      - The bulk velocity of the medium relative to the model coordinate frame.
      - If the material consists of non-spherical (spheroidal) particles, the magnetic field
        vector, which will be used to determine the direction and degree of alignment.

    The material properties at a particular spatial position in a medium are defined by an instance
    of a MaterialMix subclass. While the specific properties (such as, e.g., the scattering albedo)
    may vary with location, the material type and the level of support for various physical
    processes (such as, e.g., polarization) must be the same throughout the spatial domain (for a
    particular medium). Often, a Medium subclass employs just a single MaterialMix object to define
    material properties everywhere. In more complex situations, a family of MaterialMix objects of
    the same type may provided, for example, parameterized on a quantity imported from a
    hydrodynamical snapshot.

    Because the material must be of the same type throughout the spatial domain, a particular
    Medium instance has a well-defined material type (i.e. dust, electrons, or gas). It is not
    possible for a single Medium object to carry more than one material type. This limitation can
    be overcome by configuring multiple media, each with its own type, even if their spatial
    distribution happens to be defined by the same synthetic geometry or is imported from the same
    hydrodynamical snapshot.

    There is a complication for situations where the simulation is requested to self-consistently
    calculate the densities for multiple material types from the radiation field. For example, one
    could determine the amount of dust in a given location from the local gas state, including
    parameters such as the kinetic gas temperature or the degree of ionization. Because changing
    the dust density will influence the radiation field, this is clearly an iterative process, and
    it requires interaction with multiple Media objects. In this case, the density distributions in
    the media configured by the user merely serve as an initial state, which will be updated by the
    iterative state calculations.

    The spatial distribution of a medium may be represented internally using number density or mass
    density, at the choice of the implementation. Refer to the MaterialMix class header for more
    information on the conversion between number of entities and masses for each type of material.
