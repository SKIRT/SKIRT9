/** A CellSnapshot object represents the data in a Cartesian mesh-based snapshot imported from a
    column text file. Each line in the text file represents a cuboidal cell lined up with the
    coordinate axes, specifying the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right corners of the
    cell along with properties such as the density in the cell. The intention is for the cells to
    define a partition of the spatial domain, and usually they will, however this is not enforced.
    When two or more cells overlap at a given position, the properties for that position will be
    taken from the cell that is listed first in the imported file. When no cells overlap a given
    position, the density at that position is considered to be zero. To avoid thin slices of zero
    density between cells, the coordinates for common walls or corners in neighboring cells should
    be identical.

    This class is an alternative to the AdaptiveMeshSnapshot class, which requires listing cells in
    Morton order. This can be hard to accomplish, especially when extracting a particular subdomain
    from a larger mesh. In contrast, the CellSnapshot class allows cells to be listed in arbitrary
    order and allows the spatial partition to be imperfect. For example, the outer border of the
    domain can be ragged, with some cells extending farther out than others.

    This class is based on the Snapshot class; it uses the facilities offered there to configure
    and read the snapshot data, and it implements all functions in the general Snapshot public
    interface. If the snapshot configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a
    given spatial position, an effort is made to accelerate the search for the cell containing that
    position even for a large number of cells. */

        the configuration functions, stores the data for later use, and closes the file by calling
        the base class Snapshot::readAndClose() function.

        Cells with an associated temperature above the cutoff temperature (if one has been
        configured) are assigned a density value of zero, so that they have zero mass regardless of
        the imported mass/density properties. Note that we cannot simply ignore these cells because
        an empty cell may overlap and thus hide (a portion of) a nonempty cell later in the list.

        The function also logs some statistical information about the import. If the snapshot
        configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a given spatial position,
        this function builds a data structure that accelerates the search for the appropriate cell.
