/** This class allows reading a table of floating point values from a column text file with support
    for unit conversions. The filename is specified in the constructor, and information about the
    columns expected in the file is specified by calling the addColumn() function for each column.

    When reading a column text file, empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored, except for
    the unit specification header lines described below. Other lines must contain a predefined
    number of floating point values separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs). The number of
    expected values is determined for each input file under program control. It is an error for a
    line to contain fewer values than expected (or for any of the values to be improperly
    formatted). On the other hand, any additional information on a line beyond the last expected
    value is ignored.

    Header lines
    ------------

    It is recommended that the header of the input file includes column information in the format
    described below. This provides formal documentation about the contents of the file and
    specifies the units used for the values in each column. If there is no column information in
    the file (i.e. none of the header lines match the syntax decribed below), the default units
    are used as specified by the program (i.e. the client class invoking TextInFile).

    For example, a two-column input file might have the following header:

        # My personal SED written from Python
        # column 1: wavelength (Angstrom)
        # column 2: specific luminosity (W/Hz)
        #
        ... data ...

    There must be a header line for each column with the following contents from left to right:
      - the hash character indicating a header line
      - the word "column" (case insensitive)
      - the one-based column number (optional)
      - a colon
      - a description that does not contain parenthesis (optional)
      - a unit string between parenthesis (may be "(1)" or "()" for dimensionless quantities)

    Extra whitespace is allowed between the various fields. The unit string must exactly match one
    of the unit strings supported by SKIRT for the expected quantity. The column info lines must
    occur in the same order as the data columns. Extra header lines are allowed between, before,
    and after the column info lines.

    Column order
    ------------

    By default, the columns in the file must be in the exact order as expected by the program (i.e.
    the client class invoking TextInFile). However, some client classes offer a user-configurable
    \em useColumns property that allows column reordering, as described in the documentation for
    the TextInFile::useColumns() function.

    Stored columns file format
    --------------------------

    Reading large text files can be very slow. Therefore, in certain cases, this class supports the
    possibility to provide the input file in a much faster SKIRT-specific binary file format, i.e.
    the stored columns format described in the StoredColumns class. This file format has the
    following limitations:

    - being a binary format, the files are not human readable.
    - a (binary) file header with column names and unit strings must always be included.
    - the column names and unit strings have a maximum length of 8 characters each.
    - there is no support for non-leaf rows, so the format cannot be used for representing
      adaptive mesh data.

    If the input file provided to the TextInFile constructor has the \c .scol filename extension,
    the implementation automatically switches to reading the binary file format instead of the
    regular column text format. This is fully transparent to the caller of the TextInFile class.

{
    //=============== Construction - Destruction  ==================

public:
    /** The constructor opens the specified file for reading; if the file can't be opened, a
        FatalError is thrown. The constructor takes several arguments: (1) \em item specifies a
        simulation item in the hierarchy of the caller (usually the caller itself) used to retrieve
        the input file path and an appropriate logger; (2) \em filename specifies the name of the
        file, including filename extension but excluding path and simulation prefix; (3) \em
        description describes the contents of the file for use in the log message issued after the
        file is successfully opened; (4) \em resource indicates whether the file is located in the
        resources directory (true) or in the regular user input file directory (false, the default
        value).

        If the specified file has the \c .scol filename extension, the implementation automatically
        switches to reading the binary SKIRT column file format instead of the regular column text
        format. For more information, see the class header. */
    TextInFile(const SimulationItem* item, string filename, string description, bool resource = false);

    /** This function closes the file if it was not already closed. It is best to call close() or
        allow the object to go out of scope before logging other messages or starting another
        significant chunk of work. */
    void close();

    /** The destructor calls the close() function. It is best to call close() or allow the object
        to go out of scope before logging other messages or starting another significant chunk of
        work. */
    ~TextInFile();

    //====================== Other functions =======================

    /** The \em columns string argument of this function specifies a mapping between the "physical"
        columns in the file (defined by the column information in the file header) and the
        "logical" columns expected by the program (defined by the TextInFile client through
        repeated calls to the addColumn() function). Once this mapping has been established, the
        program only sees the logical ordering. In other words, the subsequent calls to the
        addColumn() function are matched to the corresponding logical columns, and the readXxx()
        functions retrieve logical columns only.

        The useColumns() function can be called with a non-empty \em columns string at most once
        for each file, and such invocation should occur \em before the first invocation of the
        addColumn() function. Calling this function with an empty \em columns string is equivalent
        to not calling it at all.

        If the \em columns string is non-empty, the input file must contain valid column
        information in the file header, as described in the header of this class.

        <b>Explicit column re-ordering</b>

        The \em columns string is interpreted as a comma-separated sequence of physical column
        names. Within each column name, consecutive white space characters are replaced by a single
        space, and white space at the start and at the end is removed. The following rules then
        apply:

        - Each physical column name in the string must be equal to exactly one of the file column
        descriptions, unambiguously identifying a particular physical column.

        - The order and number of the physical column names in the string must correspond to the
        order and number of logical columns expected by the program, defining a mapping between the
        physical file column ordering and the logical column ordering.

        - A given physical column name cannot occur multiple times in the string, i.e. a physical
        column can map to at most one logical column.

        - It is allowed for the file to contain physical columns that are not named in the string.

        As an exception to the above rules, the special column name "0" does not map to a column in
        the file but instead introduces a "virtual" logical column containing zero values. This
        avoids the need for including zero-value columns in the file.

        <b>Automatic column re-ordering</b>

        If the \em columns string is equal to "*" or "*0", automatic column re-ordering is
        activated. In this mode, the names provided in the file header for physical columns must
        match logical column names. The following rules apply:

        - For each logical column expected by the program, the file should include a physical
        column with the same name, in any position (allowing arbitrary physical ordering). If there
        is no such column, a fatal error is thrown if the \em columns string is "*", or a virtual
        zero column is introduced if the \em columns string is "*0".

        - It is allowed for the file to contain physical columns that do no match an expected
        logical name.

        */
    void useColumns(string columns);

    /** This function (virtually) adds a new column to the text file, characterized by the given
        description and unit information. The \em description argument is used only for logging
        purposes. The \em quantity argument specifies the physical quantity represented by the
        column. It must match one of the quantity strings supported by the Units system, or one of
        the special quantity strings recognized by this class (see below). The \em defaultUnit
        argument specifies the default unit string, which is used in case the input file does not
        contain column information.

        In addition to the quantity strings supported by the Units system, this function supports
        the following special quantity strings.

        - The empty string (the default argument value): indicates a dimensionless quantity; the
        default unit must be the empty string as well.

        - The string "specific": indicates a quantity that represents a specific luminosity per
        unit of wavelength, frequency or energy with arbitrary scaling because the values will be
        normalized by the client after being read. The function determines the unit style (per
        wavelength, frequency or energy) based on the units given in the file header or the default
        units. The values are always converted to "per wavelength" style assuming a wavelength
        given by the value of the first preceding column described as "wavelength". However, the
        values will remain scaled with some arbitary wavelength-independent constant.

        The function looks for and, if present, reads the header information line corresponding to
        this column. The unit information from the header is stored with the information provided
        by the function arguments for later use. */

    /** This function reads the next row from a column text file and stores the resulting values in
        the array passed to the function by reference. The function first skips empty lines and
        lines starting with a hash character, and then reads a single text line containing data
        values separated by white space.

        The number of expected values corresponds to the number of columns in the file, which is
        determined by repeated calls to the addColumn() function. If the data line contains fewer
        values than expected, or if any of the values is improperly formatted for a floating point
        number, the function throws a FatalError (the size and contents of the \em values array are
        undefined). Any additional information on the line beyond the last expected value is
        ignored.

        If a row was successfully read, the input values are converted from the input units (as
        specified in the file header or using the default given in the addColumn() function) to
        SKIRT-internal units. Finally, the \em values array is set to the appropriate length, the
        converted input values are stored into it in column order, and the function returns true.

        If the end of the file is reached before a row can be read, the function returns false and
        the size and contents of the \em values array are undefined. */

        must be followed by three integers (one subdivision specifier for each dimension).

        If the next line (after skipping comments and empty lines) starts with an exclamation mark,
        the function processes it as a nonleaf node specification. If this is successful, the
        function stores the parsed specifiers in the arguments and returns true. If the line cannot
        be parsed, a fatal error is thrown.

        If the next line (after skipping comments and empty lines) does not start with an
        exclamation mark, the contents of the function arguments is undefined and the function
        returns false. In this case, the function has not consumed any information other than
