        spherical symmetry only the intersection with the xy plane is written, for axial symmetry
        the intersections with the xy and xz planes are written, and for general geometries all
        three intersections are written. In the latter case, an extra file with three-dimensional
        information is written as well.

        The function is called from the SpatialGridPlotProbe class, and receives a pointer to the
        probe as its argument. The output files are called <tt>prefix_probe_grid_XXX.dat</tt>,
        where XXX is replaced by "xy", "xz", "yz" or "xyz" depending on the file under
        consideration. Within a file, each line contains two coordinates seperated by whitespace or
        is empty. Consecutive nonempty lines represent a sequence of "lineto" commands; an empty
        line marks a "moveto" command.

        The default implementation of this function invokes the write_XXX() functions as
        appropriate for the dimension of the grid. Subclasses usually override the write_XXX()
        functions, but can opt to override this function instead if that makes more sense. */
