        the intersections with the xy and xz planes are written, and for general geometries all
        three intersections are written. In the latter case, an extra file with three-dimensional
        information is written as well.

        The function is called from the SpatialGridPlotProbe class, and receives a pointer to the
        probe as its argument. The output files are called <tt>prefix_probe_grid_XXX.dat</tt>,
        where XXX is replaced by "xy", "xz", "yz" or "xyz" depending on the file under
        consideration. Within a file, each line contains two coordinates seperated by whitespace or
        is empty. Consecutive nonempty lines represent a sequence of "lineto" commands; an empty
        line marks a "moveto" command.

        appropriate for the dimension of the grid. Subclasses usually override the write_XXX()
        functions, but can opt to override this function instead if that makes more sense. */
