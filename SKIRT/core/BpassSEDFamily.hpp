/** An instance of the BpassSEDFamily class represents a BPASS family of single stellar population
    (SSP) %SED templates (Eldridge, Stanway et al, 2017, PASA 34, 58; Stanway and Eldridge, 2018,
    MNRAS, 479, 75). We use the BPASS data release version 2.2.1 (July 2018) of the model that
    includes binary stellar systems and that assumes a Chabrier IMF with an upper mass limit of 300
    solar masses (the "bin-imf_chab300" model).

    The SED templates are parametrized on metallicity (1e-5 - 0.04) and age (1 Myr - 100 Gyr), and
    scale with the initial mass of the SSP. The wavelength grid has a resolution of 1 Angstrom over
    the complete range (1 Angstrom - 10 micron). This corresponds to a spectral resolution as shown
    in the figure below.

    The data were downloaded from the BPASS web site at https://bpass.auckland.ac.nz/9.html and
    converted to SKIRT stored table format for inclusion in the <b>optional</b> BPASS resource
    pack. The stored table is opened during setup, and it is subsequently interpolated to the
    desired parameters and wavelength grid when needed.

    When imported from a text column file, the parameters for this %SED family must appear in the
    following order in the specified default units (unless these units are overridden by column
    header info): \f[ M_\mathrm{init}\,(\mathrm{M}_\odot) \quad Z\,(\mathrm{dimensionless}) \quad
    t\,(\mathrm{yr}) \f]

    <b>IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE USER</b>

    Because of its substantial size (450 MB compressed) the resource file required by this class is
    contained in a separate, <b>optional</b> resource pack, which can be installed by running the
    \c downloadResources.sh shell script in the SKIRT \c git directory or can be obtained from the
    download page on the SKIRT web site. */
