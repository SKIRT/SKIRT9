/** DisjointWavelengthGrid is an abstract class that represents wavelength grids with
    straightforward, non-overlapping bins with constant transmission across each bin.

    Specifically, a disjoint wavelength grid consists of non-overlapping but possibly adjacent
    wavelength bins in increasing wavelength order, with constant maximum transmission within the
    bins and zero transmission outside of the bins. Each bin is defined by its left and right
    borders and has a characteristic wavelength that falls inside the bin. The left border is
    considered to be inside of the bin; the right border is considered to be outside of the bin.
    Neighboring bins may have a common border but can also be disconnected.

    Formally, assuming \f$N>0\f$ bins with zero-based indices, we have \f[
    \lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell \le \lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell < \lambda^\mathrm{right}_\ell, \quad
    \ell=0\dots N-1 \f] and if \f$N>1\f$, we additionally have \f[ \lambda^\mathrm{right}_\ell \le
    \lambda^\mathrm{left}_{\ell+1}, \quad \ell=0\dots N-2. \f] Finally, each bin of course has an
    associated bin width, \f[\lambda^\mathrm{right}_\ell - \lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell > 0, \quad
    \ell=0\dots N-1.\f]

    A DisjointWavelengthGrid subclass is expected to invoke one of the setWavelengthXXX() functions
    during setup to initialize the wavelength grid. The current implementation offers two such
    functions: one to specify a consecutive range of adjacent wavelength bins given a list of
    characteric wavelengths, and another one to specify distinct, nonadjacent wavelength bins given
    a list of characteric wavelengths and a relative bin width. Other options can be added as the
    need arises. */

    /** This function verifies that the wavelength bins have been initialized by a subclass calling
        one of the setWavelengthXXX() functions of this class in their setupSelfBefore() function.

    void setupSelfAfter() override;

    /** This function initializes the wavelength grid to a consecutive range of adjacent wavelength
        bins given a list of characteric wavelengths. The subclass determines a list of characteric
        wavelengths according to some predefined scheme, and the bin borders and bin widths are
        automatically determined from that list by this function. If the specified wavelength list
        is empty, or if there are duplicate values (which would lead to empty bins), the function
        throws a fatal error.

        The function first sorts the specified characteristic wavelengths in ascending order and
        then calculates the bin borders assuming linear or logarithmic scaling depending on the
        value of the \em logScale flag. The inner border between two consecutive characteristic
        wavelengths is placed at the mid-point of those two wavelengths (in linear or logarithmic
        space), and the outer borders at the edges of the wavelength range are placed such that the
        outer bins have the same width as the respective adjacent bins (in linear or logarithmic
        space). If the wavelength grid has just a single wavelength, the borders are placed just
        next to the wavelength to form a narrow bin. Finally, the function trivially calculates the
        wavelength bin widths from the bin borders.

        For linear scaling, the corresponding formulas are trivial. For logarithmic scaling, the
        formalas in logarithmic space translate easily to equivalent but more efficient formulas in
        real space. For the inner borders this yields the geometric mean of the two adjacent
        characteristic wavelengths, i.e. \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_{\ell-1} =
        \lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell = \sqrt{\lambda^\mathrm{c}_{\ell-1}\lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell}\;,
        \ell=1\dots N-1\f$. The leftmost outer border is placed at \f$\lambda^\mathrm{left}_0 =
        \sqrt{(\lambda^\mathrm{c}_{0})^3/\lambda^\mathrm{c}_1}\f$, and the rightmost outer border
        is placed at \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_{N-1} =
        \sqrt{(\lambda^\mathrm{c}_{N-1})^3/\lambda^\mathrm{c}_{N-2}}\f$.

        If there is just a single wavelength in the grid, the outer borders are placed (for both
        linear and logarithmic scaling) according to \f$\lambda^\mathrm{left}_0 =
        \lambda^\mathrm{c}_{0}(1-1/1000)\f$ and \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_0 =
        \lambda^\mathrm{c}_{0}(1+1/1000)\f$. */

        borders and bin widths are automatically calculated from that information by this function.
        If the specified wavelength list is empty, or if the relative half bin width is not
        positive, or if the calculated bins overlap, the function throws a fatal error.

        Specifically, the function first sorts the specified characteristic wavelengths in
        ascending order and then calculates the bin borders using \f$\lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell =
        \lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell(1-w)\f$ and \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_\ell =
        \lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell(1+w)\;, \ell=0\dots N-1\f$, where \f$w\f$ is the specified relative
        half bin width. If the \em constantWidth flag is true, the width for the shortest
        wavelength is used for all bin widths instead. Finally the function trivially calculates
        the wavelength bin widths from the bin borders. */

        would lead to empty bins), the function throws a fatal error.

        i.e. that lies between two non-adjacent bins. In other words, this option allows to (1)
