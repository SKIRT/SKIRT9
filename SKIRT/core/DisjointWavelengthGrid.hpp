/** DisjointWavelengthGrid is an abstract class that represents wavelength grids with
    straightforward, non-overlapping bins with constant transmission across each bin.

    Specifically, a disjoint wavelength grid consists of \f$N>0\f$ non-overlapping but possibly
    adjacent wavelength bins in increasing wavelength order. Each bin is defined by its left and
    right borders. The left border is considered to be inside of the bin; the right border is
    considered to be outside of the bin. Furthermore, each bin is characterized by a characteristic
    wavelength that falls inside the bin, i.e. \f$\lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell \le
    \lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell < \lambda^\mathrm{right}_\ell, \ell=0\dots N-1\f$. Finally, each bin of
    course has an associated bin width, \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_\ell -
    \lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell, \ell=0\dots N-1\f$.

    A DisjointWavelengthGrid subclass is expected to invoke one of the setWavelengthXXX() functions
    during setup to intialize the wavelength grid. The current implementation offers two such
    functions: one to specify a consecutive range of adjacent wavelength bins given a list of
    characteric wavelengths, and another one to specify distinct, nonadjacent wavelength bins given
    a list of characteric wavelengths and a relative bin width. Other options can be added as the
    need arises. */

    /** This function verifies that the wavelength bins have been initialized by a subclass calling
        the one of the setWavelengthXXX() functions of this class in their setupSelfBefore()
        function. */
    void setupSelfAfter() override;

    /** This function initializes the wavelength grid to a consecutive range of adjacent wavelength
        bins given a list of characteric wavelengths. This function or one of its alternatives
        should be called from the setupSelfBefore() function in each WavelengthGrid subclass. The
        subclass determines a list of characteric wavelengths according to some predefined scheme,
        and the bin borders and bin widths are automatically determined from that list by this
        function. If the specified wavelength list is empty, or if there are duplicate values
        (which would lead to empty bins), the function throws a fatal error.

        The function first sorts the specified characteristic wavelengths in ascending order and
        then calculates the bin borders assuming linear or logarithmic scaling depending on the
        value of the \em logScale flag. The inner border between two consecutive characteristic
        wavelengths is placed at the mid-point of those two wavelengths (in linear or logarithmic
        space), and the outer borders at the edges of the wavelength range are placed such that the
        outer bins have the same width as the respective adjacent bins (in linear or logarithmic
        space). If the wavelength grid has just a single wavelength, the borders are placed just
        next to the wavelength to form a narrow bin. Finally, the function trivially calculates the
        wavelength bin widths from the bin borders.

        For linear scaling, the corresponding formulas are trivial. For logarithmic scaling (the
        default), the formalas in logarithmic space translate easily to equivalent but more
        efficient formulas in real space. For the inner borders this yields the geometric mean of
        the two adjacent characteristic wavelengths, i.e. \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_{\ell-1} =
        \lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell = \sqrt{\lambda^\mathrm{c}_{\ell-1}\lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell}\;,
        \ell=1\dots N-1\f$. The leftmost outer border is placed at \f$\lambda^\mathrm{left}_0 =
        \sqrt{(\lambda^\mathrm{c}_{0})^3/\lambda^\mathrm{c}_1}\f$, and the rightmost outer border
        is placed at \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_{N-1} =
        \sqrt{(\lambda^\mathrm{c}_{N-1})^3/\lambda^\mathrm{c}_{N-2}}\f$.

        If there is just a single wavelength in the grid, the outer borders are placed (for both
        linear and logarithmic scaling) according to \f$\lambda^\mathrm{left}_0 =
        \lambda^\mathrm{c}_{0}(1-1/1000)\f$ and \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_0 =
        \lambda^\mathrm{c}_{0}(1+1/1000)\f$.  */

        WavelengthGrid subclass. The subclass determines a list of characteric wavelengths and a
        relative half bin width, and the bin borders and bin widths are automatically calculated
        from that information by this function. If the specified wavelength list is empty, or if
        the relative half bin width is not positive, or if the calculated bins overlap, the
        function throws a fatal error.

        Specifically, the function first sorts the specified characteristic wavelengths in
        ascending order and then calculates the bin borders using \f$\lambda^\mathrm{left}_\ell =
        \lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell(1-w)\f$ and \f$\lambda^\mathrm{right}_\ell =
        \lambda^\mathrm{c}_\ell(1+w)\;, \ell=0\dots N-1\f$, where \f$w\f$ is the specified relative
        half bin width. If the \em constantWidth flag is true, the width for the shortest
        wavelength is used for all bin widths instead. Finally the function trivially calculates
