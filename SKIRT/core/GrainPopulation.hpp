/** GrainPopulation is simple class that represents a particular dust grain population. A grain
    population is essentially defined by the combination of a grain composition (an instance of a
    GrainComposition subclass) providing the optical and calorimetric properties of the grain
    material, and a grain size distribution (an instance of a GrainSizeDistribution subclass). In
    addition, the amount of dust contained in the population is specified, in one of three ways: as
    an absolute dust mass per hydrogen atom, as a ratio of dust mass per hydrogen mass, or by using
    a given proportionality factor on the size distribution (which in that case should have some
    known normalization).

    Finally, a grain population specifies the number of grain size bins (on a logarithmic scale)
    that should be used when calculating emission spectra for the grain population. Because the
    emissivity is nonlinear as a function of grain size, the calculation is performed for a
    representative grain in each bin. A larger number of bins results in higher accuracy. On the
    other hand, the required computation time and memory consumption increase roughly linearly with
    the number of bins. */
