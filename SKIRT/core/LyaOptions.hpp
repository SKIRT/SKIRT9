    /** The enumeration type indicating the supported Lyman-alpha acceleration schemes.

        In a high-optical-depth medium, the number of scatterings for photon packets near the
        Lyman-alpha line is so high, and the corresponding free path lengths so short, that the
        Monte Carlo photon cycle becomes prohibitively slow. The core-skipping acceleration
        mechanism, first introduced by Ahn et al. 2002 (ApJ, 567:922-930) and used by many authors
        since, forces the wavelength of some photon packets from the core of the Lyman-alpha line
        into the wings of the line. This dramatically reduces the scattering cross section,
        allowing the photon packet to escape. More specifically, all photon packets with a
        dimensionless frequency \f$x\f$ smaller than a given critical value \f$x_\mathrm{crit}\f$
        are treated this way.

        SKIRT implements three variations of the core-skipping acceleration scheme:

        - \em None: no acceleration is performed, corresponding to \f$x_\mathrm{crit}=0\f$. This
        can be useful for models with low optical depths, or to produce reference results for
        models with medium optical depths. For models with high optical depths, the run times will
        be prohibitively long.

        - \em Constant: acceleration with a constant critical value given by
        \f$x_\mathrm{crit}=3s\f$, where \f$s\f$ is the acceleration strength configured by the
        user. This option can be useful when the optical depth is fairly constant throughout the
        model, as is the case with many benchmark models.

        - \em Variable: acceleration with a variable critical value that depends on the local gas
        temperature and density. Specifically, the critical value is determined as \f[
        x_\mathrm{crit} = s\, \left( \frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{T} \right)^{1/6}, \f] where \f$s\f$ is the
        acceleration strength configured by the user and \f$n_\mathrm{H}\f$ is the neutral hydrogen
        number density (in \f$\mathrm{m}^{-3}\f$) and \f$T\f$ the gas temperature (in K) in the
        spatial cell hosting the scattering event. The rationale behind this formula is discussed
        below. This variable mechanism is applicable for most models, and is preferred for models
        with a broad dynamic range in optical depths.

        For both the constant and variable schemes, the user can configure the acceleration
        strength \f$s\f$, with a default value of unity. Larger values will decrease run time and
        accuracy; smaller values will increase run time and accuracy.

        <b>Rationale for the variable scheme</b>

        The approximate analytical solutions for the Lyman-alpha spectrum emerging from a static
        slab or sphere (Neufeld 1990, Dijkstra et al. 2006) depend on the product \f$a\tau_0\f$,
        where \f$a\f$ is the Voigt parameter and \f$\tau_0\f$ is the optical depth at the
        Lyman-alpha line center. Inspired by this result, many authors proposed acceleration
        schemes where \f$x_\mathrm{crit}\f$ is determined as a function of this product. For
        example, Smith et al. 2015 (MNRAS, 449, 4336-4362) used a critical value proportional to
        \f$(a\tau_0)^{1/3}\f$.

        However, calculating the optical depth requires selecting a path length. This has forced
        these schemes to depend on either a local scale (such as the size of the current spatial
        cell) or a global scale (such as the domain size). Both options seem undesirable, as they
        lead to a dependency on non-physical parameters (the resolution of the discretization or
        the portion of the physical world included in the model). Interestingly, Smith et al. 2015
        (MNRAS, 449, 4336-4362) noted that one could use the Jeans length as a physically motivated
        length scale. Expressing the Jeans length as well as the other quantities in
        \f$(a\tau_0)^{1/3}\f$ as a function of the local gas properties leads to \f$x_\mathrm{crit}
        \propto (n_\mathrm{H}/T)^{1/6}\f$. With the gas properties expressed in SI units,
        experiments with benchmark models show that a proportionality factor of order unity is
        appropriate. */
