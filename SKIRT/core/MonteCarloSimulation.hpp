/** The MonteCarloSimulation class is the top-level class describing a SKIRT simulation. It holds
    the source, media, instrument and probe systems, implements the core aspects of the photon
    packet life-cycle, and manages the iterative processes in the simulation (including phases,
    iterations and segments). Running a Monte Carlo simulation with SKIRT essentially comes down to
    constructing an instance of the MonteCarloSimulation class and invoking the setupAndRun()
    function on it. The runSimulation() function performs all segments of the simulation, calling
    functions such as runPrimaryEmission() and runSecondaryEmission() as required. These functions
    in turn invoke the performLifeCycle() function to trace photon packets through their complete
    life cycle, including emission, scattering events, peel-off towards the instruments, and
    registration of the contribution to the radiation field in each spatial cell crossed.

    The MonteCarloSimulation class also holds the non-discoverable \em config property, which is
    automatically set to an instance of the Configuration class. The setup() function of the config
    object is invoked at the very early stages of overall simulation setup, so that it can
    initialize its internal state to reflect the simulation configuration. As a result, it is safe
    for other simulation items to retrieve information from the config object during setup.

    <b>%Simulation phases, iterations and segments</b>

    In a first simulation phase, SKIRT determines the radiation field (RF) based on just the
    primary emission. In a second phase, it performs secondary emission using spectra calculated
    based on this RF.

    Some SKIRT media allow the density and/or the optical properties of the medium to depend on the
    local RF. These changes to the medium properties may sufficiently affect the RF to again cause
    a significant change in the medium properties, so that the RF must be calculated
    self-consistently by iterating over primary and/or secondary emission. We call this a \em
    dynamic \em medium \em state (DMS). A DMS update algorithm can be defined as part of the
    MaterialMix subclass that defines the complete behavior of a given material type, or it can be
    defined separately in a DynamicStateRecipe subclass, which can access any of the configured
    medium components. The latter option enables a single recipe to control different material
    types and it allows offering alternate recipes without complicating the material mix
    implementation.

    If the changes to the medium state significantly affect the medium opacity in the wavelength
    range of primary sources, iteration over primary emission is required. We call this a \em
    primary-dynamic \em medium \em state (PDMS). Radiative dust destruction is an example of a PDMS
    process.

    Alternatively, the media properties depending on the RF may be significant only for determining
    the secondary emission spectrum without a noticable effect during primary emission. As a
    result, there is no need for iteration over primary emission. We call this a \em
    secondary-dynamic \em medium \em state (SDMS). The hydrogen spin-flip transition is an example
    of an SDMS process because the opacity change at 21 cm does not affect primary emission at much
    shorter wavelengths (in this specific example, there is actually no need for iteration over the
    secondary emission either, but this might be different for other processes).

    Similarly, secondary emission may sufficiently affect the RF to cause a significant change in
    the secondary emission spectrum (which is calculated from that RF). If this is the case, the RF
    must be calculated self-consistently by iterating over the secondary emission. We call this \em
    dynamic \em secondary \em emission (DSE). One can consider DSE as a special case of SDMS where
    the change in the medium state is handled implicitly during the calculations rather than being
    explicitly stored. Dust emission in high-optical depth regions is an example of a DSE process.
    The dust temperature (or temperature probability distribution) is calculated on the fly while
    determining the emission spectrum from the RF.

    A simulation consecutively performs one or more \em segments as part of the relevant \em
    iterations and \em phases. A segment processes a set of photon packets, including emission from
    the relevant sources or media, absorption and scattering by the media, and updating the RF, the
    medium state, and/or the instruments as appropriate. We define the following segment types:

    - \f$\mathbf{P}\f$ -- primary emission: photon packets are launched from the configured
    (primary) source components.

    - \f$\mathbf{S}\f$ -- secondary emission: photon packets are launched from the configured
    medium components that support emission; this includes calculation of the secondary emission
    spectrum for each component based on the RF and the medium state in each spatial cell at the
    start of the segment.

    These segment identifiers are decorated by one or more of the following modifiers:

    - \f$p\f$: peel off a photon packet to the instruments for each emission and scattering event.

    - \f$r\f$: register the RF while tracing photon packets through the medium.

    - \f$(r)\f$: optionally register the RF if requested for probing (not needed for instruments).

    - \f$s\f$: update the PDMS based on the RF after processing all photon packets for the segment.

    - \f$(s)\f$: update the SDMS, if any, based on the RF after processing all photon packets for
    the segment.

    <b>%Simulation mode configuration</b>

    The user-configurable \em simulationMode enumeration sets the overall simulation mode. It
    determines the presence or absence of a transfer medium, the wavelength regime (oligochromatic
    or panchromatic), whether there is a secondary emission phase, and if so, which media types
    (dust and/or gas) are emitting photon packets. The Boolean user options \em
    iteratePrimaryEmission and \em iterateSecondaryEmission (plus \em includePrimaryEmission in the
    IterationOptions) further determine whether the simulation iterates over the radiation field to
    self-consistently calculate a DMS and/or DSE. The presence of DMS update algorithms is detected
    at run-time from the capabilities advertised by the configured media and recipes.

    An important aspect determined by the simulation mode is the simulation's wavelength regime,
    which can be oligochromatic or panchromatic. Oligochromatic simulations use just a few
    pre-defined, discrete wavelengths. They do no support kinematics (moving sources and/or media)
    because the wavelengths cannot shift away from the pre-defined values, and they do not support
    secondary emission by the transfer medium because the radiation field must be known across a
    wide spectrum to calculate the medium state and the resulting emission. Panchromatic
    simulations use a continuous range of wavelengths, lifting these limitations.

    The "extinction-only" simulation modes calculate the extinction of the primary radiation
    through the configured media, including the effects of absorption and scattering. There is no
    secondary emission, so these modes are meaningful only for wavelengths at which secondary
    sources (radiation from the media) can be neglected. The "emission" simulation modes (which
    require a panchromatic wavelength range) include secondary emission from dust and/or gas, in
    addition to the effects of absorption and scattering.

    The prefix \c Dust-, \c Gas-, or \c DustAndGas- in the emission simulation modes indicates
    which media types are emitting photon packets during secondary emission. Other media types can
    still be configured in the simulation and will contribute extinction during both primary and
    secondary emission.

    The simulation mode and iteration flags are set at the start of the configuration process.
    Their values have a significant impact on which options are allowed or required in the
    simulation's configuration.

    <b>Execution flow</b>

    The following table shows the flow of execution for each simulation mode. The arrows in the
    flow diagrams indicate forward progression (\f$\rightarrow\f$) and iteration
    (\f$\longleftarrow\f$).

    | | %Simulation mode | Flow diagram |
    |-|-----------------|--------------|
    | 1 | \c OligoNoMedium | \f$\mathbf{P}^p\f$ |
    | 2 | \c OligoExtinctionOnly | \f$\mathbf{P}^p_{(r)}\f$ |

    | 4 | \c NoMedium | \f$\mathbf{P}^p\f$ |

    | 12 | ... + \em iteratePrimaryEmission + \em iterateSecondaryEmission + \em includePrimaryEmission | \f$\overleftarrow{\mathbf{P}_{rs}} \;\rightarrow\; \overleftarrow{\mathbf{P}_{r(s)} \;\rightarrow\; \mathbf{S}_{rs}} \;\rightarrow\; \mathbf{P}^p_{r(s)} \;\rightarrow\; \mathbf{S}^p_{(r)}\f$ |

    Rows 1-6 describe simulation modes that include primary emission only, without or with media.
    The last mode in this list (row 6) includes iteration over the PDMS during primary emission.
    Rows 7-12 describe modes that include dust and/or gas emission, possibly iterating over the RF
    during secondary emission to handle DSE (rows 9-12). If one or more of the media have a PDMS,
    there are modes supporting iteration over primary emission (rows 8, 10, 12) and/or over
    consecutive primary and secondary emission segments (rows 11, 12).

    If applicable, the simulation modes in rows 7-12 update the SDMS at the end of the relevant
    segments. It is meaningful to update an SDMS at the end of a segment that performs peel-off to
    the instruments because the update does not affect the outcome of a primary emission segment.

    <b>Photon life cycle</b>

    As mentioned above, each segment processes the life cycles for a set of photon packets,
    including emission and propagation through the medium and up to the instruments. The
    PhotonPacketOptions allow configuring four basic variations of the photon packet life cycle by
    enabling or disabling forced scattering and/or explicit absorption. Each of these variations
    comes with specific advantages or drawbacks, as follows:

    - With forced scattering. Forced scattering tends to reduce noise for simulations with low to
    limited optical depths, such as for most dust models on galaxy-wide scales. However, for each
    scattering event, it requires the calculation of the geometry and optical depth of the full
    path up to the model boundary, regardless of the location of the scattering event along the
    path.

    - Without forced scattering. In models with very intensive scattering, such as for Lyman-alpha
    line transfer, the photon cycle without forced scattering is often the better choice, because
    it avoids calculating the path geometry and optical depth beyond the scattering location.
    However, our implementation does not support storing the radiation field, which means this
    option cannot be used when the simulation includes secondary emission or dynamic state
    iteration.

    - Without explicit absorption. The default technique uses the extinction (sum of scattering and
    absorption) along a photon packet's path to locate the next interaction point. This requires
    the cumulative extinction optical depth to be a nondecreasing function of path length. It is
    thus not possible to handle negative extinction cross sections.

    - With explicit absorption. This technique instead used the scattering optical depth to locate
    the next interaction point. While the scattering cross section still must be nonnegative, this
    allows the extinction cross section to be negative. The latter is the case for materials that
    exhibit stimulated emission as soon as the magnitude of the negative absorption cross section
    is larger than the scattering cross section. As a drawback, this technique requires calculating
    both the scattering and absorption optical depths for the photon packet path.

    Refer to the performLifeCycle() function for more information on these life cycle variations.

        the instruments, if so requested. If the simulation contains one or more media, the photon
        packet now enters one of two life cycles: the forced scattering life cycle or the
        non-forced scattering life cycle.

        - Forced scattering. First, the geometry and optical depth information of the photon packet
        path through the medium up to the model boundary is calculated and stored in the photon
        packet. If explicit absorption is enabled, the scattering and absorption optical depth must
        be calculated separately. Otherwise, it suffices to calculate and store the extinction
        optical depth (i.e. the sum of both). Based on this information, the contribution of the
        photon packet to the radiation field in each spatial cell can be stored, if so requested.
        The packet is then propagated to a new (random) scattering position, and its weight
        (luminosity) is adjusted for the escape fraction and the absorbed energy. The details of
        this process depend on whether explicit absorption is enabled or not. Refer to the
        simulateForcedPropagation() function. If, after this adjustment, the photon packet is still
        sufficiently luminous, scattering peel-off photon packets are created and launched towards
        each instrument, if so requested, and the actual scattering event is simulated. Finally,
        the loop repeats itself. It is terminated only when the photon packet has lost a
        substantial part of its original luminosity (and hence becomes irrelevant).

        - Non-forced scattering. The photon packet is propagated to a new (random) scattering
        position, calculating the path geometry and optical depth information on the fly up to the
        interaction location. Because the path segment information is not stored, it is impossible
        to register the radiation field (in the current implementation). The details of the
        propagation process depend on whether explicit absorption is enabled or not. Refer to the
        simulateNonForcedPropagation() function. If the selected interaction point turns out to be
        beyond the model boundary, the packet is terminated. Otherwise, scattering peel-off photon
        packets are created and launched towards each instrument, if so requested, the actual
        scattering event is simulated, and the loop repeats itself.

        The first two arguments of this function specify the range of photon packet history indices
        to be handled. The \em primary flag is true to launch from primary sources, false for
        secondary sources. The \em peel flag indicates whether peeloff photon packets should be
        sent towards the instruments. The \em store flag indicates whether the contribution to the
        radiation field should be stored. */

    /** This function implements the peel-off of a photon packet after an emission event. This
        means that we create a peel-off photon packet for every instrument in the instrument
        system, which is forced to propagate in the direction of the observer instead of in the
        propagation direction determined randomly by the emission process. Each peel-off photon
        packet is subsequently fed into its target instrument for detection.

        A peel-off photon packet has the same characteristics as the original photon packet, except
        that the propagation direction is altered from the emission direction \f${\bf{k}}\f$ to the
        direction of the observer \f${\bf{k}}_{\text{obs}}\f$. For anisotropic emission, a weight
        factor is applied to the luminosity to compensate for the fact that the probability that a
        photon packet would have been emitted towards the observer is not the same as the
        probability that it is emitted in any other direction. If the source has a nonzero
        velocity, the wavelength of the peel-off photon packet is Doppler-shifted for the new
        direction. If the photon packet is polarized, the Stokes vector is rotated into the frame
        of the target instrument.

    /** This function stores the contribution of the specified photon packet to the radiation field
        in the cells crossed by the packet's path. The function assumes that both the geometric and
        optical depth information for the photon packet's path have been set; if this is not the
        case, the behavior is undefined.

        The radiation field is discretized on the spatial grid of the simulation (held by the
        MediumSystem object) and on a wavelength grid provided specifically for this purpose (see
        the Configuration::radiationFieldWLG() function for more information). Locating the
        appropriate spatial bin is trivial because each segment in the photon packet's path stores
        the index of the cell being crossed. The wavelength bin is derived from the photon packet's
        perceived wavelength in the cell under consideration, taking into account the velocity of
        the medium in that cell.

        For each segment \f$n\f$ in the photon packet's path, this function first determines the
        corresponding spatial/wavelength bin as described above. To the contents of that bin, the
        function adds the product of the mean luminosity carried by the photon packet along the
        segment and the distance covered by the segment, or \f[ (L\Delta s)_n = L_{\text{mean},n}
        \,(\Delta s)_n = L\,\text{lnmean} \left(\text{e}^{-\tau_{n-1}}, \text{e}^{-\tau_n}\right)
        \,(\Delta s)_n \f] where \f$L\f$ is the luminosity carried by the photon packet,
        \f$\text{lnmean}()\f$ is the logarithmic mean, \f$\tau_{n-1}\f$ and \f$\tau_n\f$ represent
        the cumulative optical depth at the start and end of the segment, and \f$(\Delta s)_n\f$ is
        the distance covered by the segment. Using the logarithmic mean assumes an exponential
        behavior of the exinction with distance within the segment.

        Once this information has been accumulated for all photon packets launched during a segment
        of the simulation, the mean intensity of the radiation field in each spatial/wavelength bin
        can be calculated using \f[ (J_\lambda)_{\ell,m} = \frac{ (L\Delta s)_{\ell,m}
        }{4\pi\,V_m\,(\Delta \lambda)_\ell} \f] where \f$\ell\f$ is the index of the wavelength
        bin, \f$(\Delta \lambda)_\ell\f$ is the wavelength bin width, \f$m\f$ is the spatial cell
        index, \f$V_m\f$ is the volume of the cell, and \f$(L\Delta s)_{\ell,m}\f$ has been
        accumulated over all photon packets contributing to the bin. The resulting mean intensity
        \f$J_\lambda\f$ is expressed as an amount of energy per unit of time, per unit of area, per
        unit of wavelength, and per unit of solid angle. */

    /** This function determines the next scattering location of a photon packet in a photon life
        cycle with forced scattering and simulates its propagation to that position. The function
        assumes that both the geometric and optical depth information for the photon packet's path
        have been set; if this is not the case, the behavior is undefined. This function proceeds
        in a number of steps as outlined below.

        <b>Total optical depth</b>

        We first determine the total optical depth \f$\tau_\text{path}\f$ of the photon packet's
        path. Because the path has been calculated until the edge of the simulation's spatial grid,
        \f$\tau_\text{path}\f$ is equal to the cumulative optical depth at the end of the last
        segment in the path. If explicit absorption is disabled, this step uses the extinction
        optical depth. If explicit absorption is enabled, it uses the scattering optical depth.

        <b>%Random optical depth</b>

        We then randomly generate the optical depth \f$\tau\f$ at the interaction site from an
        appropriate distribution. Given the total optical depth along the path of the photon packet
        \f$\tau_\text{path}\f$, the appropriate probability distribution for the covered optical
        depth is an exponential probability distribution cut off at \f$\tau_\text{path}\f$.
        Properly normalized, it reads as \f[ p(\tau) = \frac{{\text{e}}^{-\tau}}
        {1-{\text{e}}^{-\tau_\text{path}}} \f] where the range of \f$\tau\f$ is limited to the
        interval \f$[0,\tau_\text{path}]\f$. Instead of generating a random optical depth
        \f$\tau\f$ directly from this distribution, we use the biasing technique in order to cover
        the entire allowed optical depth range \f$[0,\tau_\text{path}]\f$ more uniformly. As the
        biased probability distribution, we use a linear combination between an exponential
        distribution and a uniform distribution, with a parameter \f$\xi\f$ setting the relative
        importance of the uniform part. In formula form, \f[ q(\tau) = (1-\xi)\, \frac{
        {\text{e}}^{-\tau} } { 1-{\text{e}}^{-\tau_\text{path}} } + \frac{\xi}{\tau_\text{path}}.
        \f] A random optical depth from this distribution is readily determined. Since we use
        biasing, the weight, or correspondingly the luminosity, of the photon packet needs to be
        adjusted with a bias factor \f$p(\tau)/q(\tau)\f$.

        <b>Interaction point</b>

        Now that the optical depth \f$\tau\f$ at the interaction site has been (randomly) chosen,
        we determine the physical position of the interaction point along the path. This is
        accomplished in two steps: a binary search among the path segments to determine the segment
        (or cell) "containing" the given cumulative optical depth, and subsequent linear
        interpolation within the cell assuming exponential behavior of the extinction. Again, if
        explicit absorption is disabled, this step uses the extinction optical depth. If explicit
        absorption is enabled, it uses the scattering optical depth.

        <b>Weight adjustment</b>

        We adjust the weight of the photon packet to compensate for the escaped and absorbed
        portions of the luminosity through multiplication by a bias factor \f$b\f$.

        If explicit absorption is disabled, the bias factor is given by the scattered fraction,
        i.e. the fraction of the luminosity that does not escape and does not get absorbed, \f[ b =
        f_\text{sca} = (1-f_\text{esc}) \,\varpi_\text{int} =
        (1-\text{e}^{-\tau^\text{ext}_\text{path}}) \,\varpi_\text{int}, \f] where
        \f$\varpi_\text{int}\f$ is the scattering albedo of the medium at the interaction point (or
        more precisely, for the spatial cell containing the interaction point).

        If explicit absorption is enabled, the factor compensating for the escape fraction remains
        the same, but now calculated using the scattering optical depth, and the albedo is replaced
        by the absorbed fraction along the path up to the interaction point, \f[ b =
        (1-\text{e}^{-\tau^\text{sca}_\text{path}}) \,\text{e}^{-\tau^\text{abs}_\text{int}}, \f]
        where \f$\tau^\text{abs}_\text{int}\f$ is the absorption optical depth at the interaction
        point.

        <b>Advance position</b>

        Finally we advance the initial position of the photon packet to the interaction point. This
        last step invalidates the photon packet's path (including geometric and optical depth
        information). The packet is now ready to be scattered into a new direction. */
    void simulateForcedPropagation(PhotonPacket* pp);

    /** This function simulates the propagation of a photon packet to the next scattering location
        in a photon life cycle without forced scattering. It proceeds in a number of steps as
        outlined below. The function returns false if the photon packet must be terminated because
        the selected interaction point is beyond the model boundary.

        <b>%Random optical depth</b>

        Because the photon packet is allowed to escape the model, we randomly generate the optical
        depth \f$\tau\f$ at the interaction site from the regular exponential distribution. The
        current implementation does not support path length biasing.

        <b>Interaction point</b>

        Now that the optical depth \f$\tau\f$ at the interaction site has been (randomly) chosen,
        we determine the physical position of the interaction point along the path. If explicit
        absorption is disabled, this step uses the extinction optical depth. If explicit absorption
        is enabled, it uses the scattering optical depth.

        The interaction point is located by generating the path segments for crossed cells one by
        one and calculating the corresponding cumulative optical depth on the fly. Once the
        cumulative optical depth at the exit point of a segment exceeds the interaction optical
        depth, we know that the interaction point must be within this segment. The physical
        interaction point is then obtained through linear interpolation within the segment,
        assuming exponential behavior of the extinction. If the cumulative optical depth of the
        path never exceeds the interaction optical depth, the photon packet escapes and is
        terminated.

        <b>Weight adjustment</b>

        We adjust the weight of the photon packet to compensate for the absorbed portion of the
        luminosity through multiplication by a bias factor \f$b\f$.

        If explicit absorption is disabled, the bias factor is given by the scattered fraction,
        which is easily obtained as the scattering albedo of the medium at the interaction point
        (or more precisely, for the spatial cell containing the interaction point), \f[ b =
        f_\text{sca} = \varpi_\text{int}. \f]

        If explicit absorption is enabled, the bias factor is given by the absorbed fraction along
        the path up to the interaction point, \f[ b = \text{e}^{-\tau^\text{abs}_\text{int}}, \f]
        where \f$\tau^\text{abs}_\text{int}\f$ is the absorption optical depth at the interaction
        point.

        <b>Advance position</b>

        Finally we advance the initial position of the photon packet to the interaction point. This
        last step invalidates the photon packet's path (including geometric and optical depth
        information). The packet is now ready to be scattered into a new direction. */
    bool simulateNonForcedPropagation(PhotonPacket* pp);

    /** This function simulates the peel-off of a photon packet before a scattering event. This
        means that, just before a scattering event, we create one or more peel-off photon packets

        direction of the observer instead of in the propagation direction determined randomly by
        the scattering process. Each peel-off photon packet is subsequently fed into its target
        instrument for detection.

        If the rest-frame scattering event may change the wavelength of the photon packet (i.e.
        other than because of the bulk velocity of the medium), it is necessary to send a separate
        peel-off packet for each medium component (to each instrument). If the wavelength cannot
        change, we can send a consolidated peel-off packet that aggregates the relevant information
        for all medium components.

        A peel-off photon packet has the same characteristics as the original photon packet, apart
        from four differences. The first one is, obviously, that the propagation direction is
        altered to the direction towards the observer. The second difference is that we have to
        alter the luminosity of the photon packet to compensate for this change in propagation
        direction in case the scattering process is anisotropic. The third difference is that the
        polarization state of the peel-off photon packet is adjusted. And the last difference is
        that the wavelength of the peel-off photon packet is properly Doppler-shifted taking into
        account the bulk velocity of the medium, and/or can be adjusted by the rest-frame
        scattering event itself.
