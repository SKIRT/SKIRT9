/** A SphericalCellSnapshot object represents the data in a 1D, 2D or 3D snapshot imported from a
    column text file and discretized using spherical coordinates.

    <em>3D data</em>

    By default, each line in the text file represents a 3D spherical cell lined up with the
    spherical coordinate axes. The columns specify the coordinates of the bordering surfaces, along
    with properties such as density. Specifically, each cell is bordered by:

    - two spheres centered on the origin defined by radii \f$0 \le r_\text{min} \le
    r_\text{max}\f$,

    - two polar half-cones defined by inclination angles \f$0 \le \theta_\text{min} \le
    \theta_\text{max} \le \pi\f$,

    - two meridional half-planes defined by azimuth angles \f$-\pi \le \varphi_\text{min} \le
    \varphi_\text{max} \le \pi\f$ with \f$\varphi_\text{max} - \varphi_\text{min} \le \pi\f$.

    \note Because of the limitations on the range of \f$\varphi\f$, a cell cannot straddle the
    negative x-axis of the Cartesian model coordinate system, and it cannot span more than half of
    the azimuth circle. Also, because of the limitations on the range of \f$\theta\f$, a cell
    cannot straddle the z-axis of the Cartesian model coordinate system.

    The intention is for the cells to define a partition of the spatial domain, and usually they
    will, however this is not enforced. When two or more cells overlap at a given position, the
    properties for that position will be taken from the cell that is listed first in the imported
    file. When no cells overlap a given position, the density at that position is considered to be
    zero. To avoid thin slices of zero density between cells, the coordinates for common walls or
    corners in neighboring cells should be identical.

    <em>Velocities</em>

    If velocity or magnetic field vectors are being imported, the class converts these from
    spherical to Cartesian coordinates using \f[\begin{aligned} v_\text{x} &=
    v_{r}\sin\theta\cos\varphi + v_\theta\cos\theta\cos\varphi - v_\varphi\sin\varphi \\ v_\text{y}
    &= v_{r}\sin\theta\sin\varphi + v_\theta\cos\theta\sin\varphi + v_\varphi\cos\varphi \\
    v_\text{z} &= v_{r}\cos\theta - v_\theta\sin\theta \end{aligned}\f] where \f$\theta =
    (\theta_\text{min} + \theta_\text{max})/2\f$ and \f$\varphi = (\varphi_\text{min} +
    \varphi_\text{max})/2\f$ are the central inclination and azimuth angles of the corresponding
    cell.

    <em>2D or 1D data</em>

    If the inclination auto-revolve feature is enabled, each line in the text file represents a 2D
    cell in the equatorial plane, defined using just the \f$r\f$ and \f$\varphi\f$ borders. After
    reading the text file, these cells will automatically be revolved around the origin using a
    user-specified number of \f$\theta\f$ bins. To enable this feature, the number of inclination
    auto-revolve bins must be set to at least 2, and all \f$\theta_\text{min}\f$ and
    \f$\theta_\text{max}\f$ values in the input file must be zero. A nonzero value in these columns
    will trigger a fatal error.

    If the azimuth auto-revolve feature is enabled, each line in the text file represents a 2D cell
    in a meridional plane, defined using just the \f$r\f$ and \f$\theta\f$ borders. After reading
    the text file, these cells will automatically be revolved around the z-axis using a
    user-specified number of \f$\varphi\f$ bins. To enable this feature, the number of azimuth
    auto-revolve bins must be set to at least 2, and all \f$\varphi_\text{min}\f$ and
    \f$\varphi_\text{max}\f$ values in the input file must be zero. A nonzero value in these
    columns will trigger a fatal error.

    Finally, if both the inclination and azimuth auto-revolve features are enabled, each line in
    the text file represents a 1D cell along a radial axis, defined using just the \f$r\f$ borders.
    After reading the text file, these 1D cells will automatically be revolved using the
    user-specified number of \f$\theta\f$ and \f$\varphi\f$ bins.

    \note It is \em not allowed to omit the unused columns; they must be present with zero values.

    If the 1D or 2D input file specifies an integrated mass type (as opposed to a mass density),
    the mass of each 1D or 2D cell is evenly distributed over the revolved 3D bins.

    For a model that includes velocities, the velocities will be converted from spherical to
    Cartesian coordinates as described above after revolving to a 3D representation. Because the
    result of this conversion depends on the inclination and azimuth angles, the user must set a
    sufficiently high number of auto-revolve bins to properly resolve the revolved velocity field.

    <em>Implementation</em>

    This class is based on the Snapshot class; it uses the facilities offered there to configure
    and read the snapshot data, and it implements all functions in the general Snapshot public
    interface. If the snapshot configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a
    given spatial position, an effort is made to accelerate the search for the cell containing that
    position even for a large number of cells. */

    //================= Construction - Destruction =================

public:
    /** This function sets the number of auto-revolve inclination and azimuth bins; see the class
        header for more information. */
    void setNumAutoRevolveBins(int numInclinationBins, int numAzimuthBins);

    //========== Reading ==========

public:
    /** This function reads the snapshot data from the input file, honoring the options set through
        the configuration functions, stores the data for later use, and closes the file by calling
        the base class Snapshot::close() function.

        Cells with an associated temperature above the cutoff temperature (if one has been
        configured) are assigned a density value of zero, so that they have zero mass regardless of
        the imported mass/density properties. Note that we cannot simply ignore these cells because
        an empty cell may overlap and thus hide (a portion of) a nonempty cell later in the list.

        If velocity and/or magnetic field vectors are being imported, the function converts these
        from spherical to Cartesian coordinates as described in the class header.

        The function also logs some statistical information about the import. If the snapshot
        configuration requires the ability to determine the density at a given spatial position,
        this function builds a data structure that accelerates the search for the appropriate cell.
