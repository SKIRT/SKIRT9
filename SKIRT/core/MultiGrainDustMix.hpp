/** MultiGrainDustMix is an abstract class implementing a dust mix described by one or more grain
    populations, each with their own grain composition and size distribution, and with or without
    support for polarization by scattering. The class offers facilities to its subclasses to add
    dust grain populations to the dust mix during initial setup. Subsequently, the class uses this
    list of grain populations to calculate the optical properties requested by the DustMix base
    class, and to implement the additional functionality offered by multi-grain-population dust
    mixes, such as calculating emission from stochastically heated dust grains.

    All grain populations added by the subclass must have a level of Mueller matrix support that
    matches the value returned by the scatteringMode() function (which may be overridden in the
    subclass). Specifically, for the HenyeyGreenstein scattering mode, \em none of the grain
    populations should offer a Mueller matrix. For the MaterialPhaseFunction and
    SphericalPolarization scattering modes, \em all of the grain populations should offer a Mueller
    matrix. If this is not the case, a fatal error will result.

    <b>Calculating representative grain properties</b>

    The getOpticalProperties() function calculates the basic representative grain properties
    expected by the DustMix base class from the following information obtained from the dust grain
    populations added by the subclass: the absorption efficiencies \f$Q^{\text{abs}}(\lambda,a)\f$,
    the scattering efficiencies \f$Q^{\text{sca}}(\lambda,a)\f$, the scattering phase function
    asymmetry parameter \f$g(\lambda,a)\f$, the Mueller matrix coefficients
    \f$S^\text{xx}(\lambda,a,\theta)\f$, the bulk density \f$\rho_{\text{bulk}}\f$ of the grain
    material, and the properly normalized grain size distribution per hydrogen atom
    \f$\Omega(a)=(\frac{\text{d}n_\text{D}}{\text{d}a})/n_\text{H}\f$ in the range
    \f$[a_\text{min},a_\text{max}]\f$.

    The properties are calculated for each wavelength \f$\lambda_\ell\f$ in the wavelength grid
    specified by the DustMix class. The values are obtained by integrating over the grain size
    distribution \f$\Omega(a)\f$ using a builtin logarithmic grid and accumulating over all grain
    populations \f$c\f$, using the formulas listed below.

    The absorption and scattering cross sections per hydrogen atom
    \f$\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}}\f$ and \f$\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}}\f$ for the
    \f$\ell\f$'th wavelength are calculated using \f[ \varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{abs}} = \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, Q^{\text{abs}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi
    a^2\, {\text{d}}a \f] and \f[ \varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{sca}} = \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, Q^{\text{sca}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi
    a^2\, {\text{d}}a. \f]

    The Mueller matrix coefficients provided by the grain population are assumed to be expressed as
    a cross section (in arbitrary units). They are thus integrated over the size distribution
    without again multiplying by the grain cross section, i.e. using \f[
    S^\text{xx}_{\ell,\text{t}} = \sum_c \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\,
    S^\text{xx}_c(\lambda_\ell,a,\theta_\text{t})\, {\text{d}}a \f]

    The representative asymmetry parameter \f$g_{\ell}\f$ is averaged over the scattering cross
    section and thus calculated using \f[ g_{\ell} = \frac{1}{\varsigma_{\ell}^{\text{sca}}} \sum_c
    \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}} \Omega_c(a)\, g_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\,
    Q^{\text{sca}}_c(\lambda_\ell,a)\, \pi a^2\, {\text{d}}a. \f]

    The dust mass per hydrogen atom \f$\mu\f$ is calculated by integrating the bulk density over
    the size distribution, \f[ \mu = \sum_c \int_{a_{\text{min},c}}^{a_{\text{max},c}}
    \Omega_c(a)\, \rho_{\text{bulk},c}\, \frac{4\pi}{3}\, a^3\, {\text{d}}a. \f]

    <b>Calculating dust emission</b>

    The representative grain properties described above and offered by the public MaterialMix
    interface supported by this class are insufficient to accurately calculate dust emission
    spectra for the dust mixture. This is so because the emission spectrum is a nonlinear function
    of (among many other things) the grain size, and thus a single grain cannot accurately
    represent a population with a (potentialy large) range of grain sizes. Furthermore, smaller
    dust grains are often not in local thermal equilibrium, and instead are heated stochastically
    by individual photon absorption events. Modeling emission for these grains involves a
    temperature probability distribution rather than just an equilibrium temperature. The
    calculation needs calorimetric properties of the grain material in addition to optical
    properties.

    It is numerically intractable to handle every possible grain size seperately. Instead, the
    MultiGrainDustMix class discretizes the grain size distribution for each type of grain material
    into a number of consecutive size bins (on a logarithmic scale), and calculates the optical and
    calorimetric properties of a representative grain for each of these bins. The number of bins
    for each type of grain material can be configured by the user. A larger number of bins improves
    the accuracy of the dust emission spectra. On the other hand, the calculation time scales
    roughly linearly with the number of bins.

    The MultiGrainDustMix class uses one of two methods to calculate the emissivity of the dust
    mix:

    - Assuming local thermal equilibrium for each representative grain (size bin): this method is
    fast but inaccurate because the equilibrium assumption is usually not justified. See the
    EquilibriumDustEmissionCalculator class for more information.

    - Calculating a temperature probability distribution for each representative grain (size bin)
    to take into account stochastically heated grains: this second method is substantially more
    accurate but also much slower. See the StochasticDustEmissionCalculator class for more
    information.
