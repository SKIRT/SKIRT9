/** Source is an abstract class representing a primary radiation source in the simulation.
    Each source (an instance of a Source subclass) must define the following information at each
    point in the spatial domain of the source (which is independent of the spatial grid in the
    simulation):
      - The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the emission averaged over the unit sphere.
      - Some normalization for the luminosity (e.g., bolometric, at a given wavelength, ...).
      - If the emission is anisotropic, the rest-frame angular distribution of the emission.
      - If the emission is polarized, the polarization state of the emission in each direction.
      - The velocity of the source relative to the model coordinate frame.

    Furthermore, each source has a function for launching a photon packet that proceeds roughly
    as follows:
      - Sample a location from the spatial density distribution.
      - Sample a wavelength from the SED at that location (also see below).
      - Determine the corresponding (possibly biased) luminosity weight
      - Determine the rest-frame angular distribution of the emission at that location and at
        that wavelength, i.e. an object offering the AngularDistribution interface (functions
        to return a random direction, and to return the probability for a given direction)
      - Determine the polarization state of the emission at that location and at that wavelength,
        i.e. an object offering the PolarizationState interface (function to return a Stokes vector
        for a given direction)
      - Determine the velocity of the source at that location
      - Pass the items listed above to the photon packet launch procedure

    Wavelengths for new photon packets can be sampled from the intrinsic spectral distribution of
    the source \f$s(\lambda)\f$ and/or from a \em bias wavelength distribution \f$b(\lambda)\f$. Both
    the bias fraction \f$\xi\f$ and the bias distribution \f$b(\lambda)\f$ can be configured by the
    user. Given these distributions and bias factor, the composite distribution \f$q(\lambda)\f$ is

    \f[ q(\lambda) = (1-\xi) s(\lambda) + \xi b(\lambda) \f]

    and the corresponding biasing weight factor becomes

    \f[ w(\lambda) = \frac{s(\lambda)}{q(\lambda)} = \frac{s(\lambda)}{(1-\xi) s(\lambda) + \xi b(\lambda)} \f]

    By default, half of the photon packet wavelengths are sampled from each of the distributions,
    and the default bias distribution spreads wavelengths logarithmically over the wavelength range
    of the source (more precisely, the logarithm of the wavelength is distributed uniformly).
