/** The SpinFlipHydrogenGasMix class describes the material properties related to the 21 cm
    spin-flip transition in neutral atomic hydrogen, including emission and absorption. The 21 cm
    emission luminosity and self-absorption opacity in a given cell are determined from gas
    properties defined in the input model (total hydrogen number density, neutral hydrogen mass
    fraction, gas metallity, gas temperature) and the local UV radiation field calculated by the
    simulation (taking into account dust extinction).

    <b>Configuring the simulation</b>

    Simulations of 21 cm the spin-flip transition usually include primary sources and a dust medium
    in addition to a medium component configured with the spin flip material mix (this class).
    During primary emission, the dust medium determines the UV radiation field, allowing the spin
    flip material mix to calculate the 21 cm line luminosity and absorption cross section for use
    during secondary emission. This calculation happens in the updateSpecificState() function,
    which is invoked at the end of primary emission (because the material mix advertises that it
    has a secondary dynamic medium state). This does imply that the 21 cm line absorption remains
    zero during primary emission, which is not a problem as long as the primary sources don't emit
    in the radio wavelength range. Thus, unless dust opacities are very high, there is no need for
    iteration over primary nor secondary emission.

    If one is not interested in dust emission (i.e. only in the 21 cm line emission), the
    simulation mode can be set to "GasEmission" and the radiation field wavelength grid can be
    limited to a single bin in the UV wavelength range. This bin should be configured to cover the
    full Lyman-Werner band (912-1110 Angstrom) so that it accurately captures all radiation that
    dissociates molecular hydrogen. Similarly, instrument wavelength grids can be limited to a
    relevant range around 21 cm line center.

    To calculate both the dust emission spectrum and the 21 line emission in the same simulation,
    the simulation mode must be set to "DustAndGasEmission" and the radiation field wavelength grid
    must now include and properly resolve the UV, optical, and infrared wavelength range. Separate
    instruments can be configured for the relevant wavelength ranges, e.g. using a logarithmic grid
    for the continuum spectrum and a linear grid for the line profile.

    The input model must provide values for the spatial distribution of four medium properties that
    remain constant during the simulation:

    - The total hydrogen number density \f$n_\mathrm{H}\f$, defined as \f$n_\mathrm{H} =
    n_\mathrm{HI} + n_\mathrm{HII} + 2\,n_\mathrm{H2}\f$, i.e. including atomic, ionized, and
    molecular hydrogen. Note the factor 2 in this equation; \f$n_\mathrm{H}\f$ in fact specifies
    the number of protons per volume rather than the number of hydrogen-like particles per volume.

    - The neutral hydrogen fraction \f$f_\mathrm{HI+H2}\f$, defined as \f$f_\mathrm{HI+H2} =
    (M_\mathrm{HI} + M_\mathrm{H2})/M_H\f$. Note that \f$f_\mathrm{HI+H2}\f$ is a mass fraction
    rather than a number density fraction.

    - The metallicity \f$Z\f$ of the gas.

    - The kinetic temperature \f$T\f$ of the gas.

    Most often, this information will be read from an input file by associating the spin flip
    material mix with a subclass of ImportedMedium. For that medium component, the ski file
    attributes \em importMetallicity and \em importTemperature <b>must</b> be set to 'true', and
    \em importVariableMixParams must be left at 'false'. The additional column required by the spin
    flip material mix (neutral hydrogen fraction) is automatically imported and is expected
    <b>after</b> all other columns. For example, if bulk velocities are also imported for this
    medium component (i.e. \em importVelocity is 'true'), the column order would be \f[ ...,
    n_\mathrm{H}, Z, T, v_\mathrm{x}, v_\mathrm{y}, v_\mathrm{z}, f_\mathrm{HI+H2} \f]

    For basic testing purposes, the spin flip material mix can also be associated with a geometric
    medium component. The geometry then defines the spatial density distribution (i.e.
    \f$n_\mathrm{H}\f$), and the spin flip material mix offers configuration properties to specify
    fixed default values for the other properties that will be used across the spatial domain.

    <b>Partitioning</b>

    While the input model is expected to define the neutral (i.e. non-ionized) hydrogen fraction,
    the partitioning of the hydrogen gas into its atomic and molecular components must be
    determined based on the the UV radiation field calculated by the simulation. Since UV radiation
    in the Lyman-Werner band (912-1110 Angstrom) dissociates molecular hydrogen, hydrogen
    partitioning schemes usually have the UV field in that wavelength range as an important
    parameter. For this purpose, this class samples the radiation field
    \f$J_\lambda(\lambda_\mathrm{UV})\f$ at \f$\lambda_\mathrm{UV}=1000\,\mathrm{Angstrom}\f$ The
    wavelength bin index for \f$\lambda_\mathrm{UV}\f$ in the radiation field grid is determined
    during setup.

    Currently, this class implements the partioning scheme described by Gnedin and Kravtsov 2011
    (ApJ 728:88). This scheme estimates the mass fraction of molecular hydrogen compared to the
    total hydrogen mass, i.e. \f$f_\mathrm{H2} = M_\mathrm{H2}/M_H\f$, where \f$M_\mathrm{H} =
    M_\mathrm{HI} + M_\mathrm{HII} + M_\mathrm{H2}\f$ denotes the total (atomic, ionized, and
    molecular) hydrogen mass. The scheme has the following three input parameters:

    - The total hydrogen number density \f$n_\mathrm{H}\f$ defined in the input model.

    - The dust-to-gas ratio \f$D\f$ relative to the representative Galactic value. Because the
    dust-to-gas ratio can be assumed to scale with metallicity, this is roughly equivalent to the
    gas metallicity relative to the solar value. In other words, \f$D=Z/0.0127\f$, where \f$Z\f$ is
    defined in the input model.

    - The dimensionless UV radiation field \f$U = J_\lambda(\lambda_\mathrm{UV}) /
    J^\mathrm{MW}_\lambda(\lambda_\mathrm{UV})\f$, obtained by normalizing the sampled UV radiation
    field to the representative Galactic value, which is taken to be
    \f$J^\mathrm{MW}_{E}(\lambda_\mathrm{UV}) = 10^{6} \,\mathrm{photons} \,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}
    \,\mathrm{s}^{-1} \,\mathrm{sr}^{-1} \,\mathrm{eV}^{-1}\f$. The latter value is converted at
    compile time from the specified photons-per-energy cgs units to the internal SKIRT
    energy-per-wavelength SI units using \f[ J^\mathrm{MW}_\lambda(\lambda_\mathrm{UV}) = 10^4 \,
    \frac{(hc)^2}{q_\mathrm{el}\lambda^3_\mathrm{UV}} J^\mathrm{MW}_{E}(\lambda_\mathrm{UV}). \f]

    The Gnedin and Kravtsov 2011 partitioning scheme is then defined by their equations (6) and
    following, which are replicated below using our notation.

    \f[ f_\mathrm{H2} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-4x-3x^3)} \f]

    \f[ x = \Lambda^{3/7}\,\ln\left( \frac{D\,n_\mathrm{H}}{\Lambda\,n_*}\right) \f]

    \f[ \Lambda = \ln\left( 1 + g D^{3/7} (U/15)^{4/7} \right) \f]

    \f[ g = \frac{1+\alpha s + s^2}{1+s} \f]

    \f[ s = \frac{0.04}{D_* + D} \f]

    \f[ \alpha = \frac{5\,U/2}{1+(U/2)^2} \f]

    \f[ n_* = 25\times 10^6 ~\mathrm{m}^{-3} \f]

    \f[ D_* = 1.5 \times 10^{-3} \times \ln\left(1 + (3 U)^{1.7} \right) \f]

    Given the total hydrogen number density \f$n_\mathrm{H}\f$ and the neutral hydrogen mass
    fraction \f$f_\mathrm{HI+H2}\f$ defined in the input model, the atomic number density can then
    be easily derived as \f$n_\mathrm{HI} = n_\mathrm{H} (f_\mathrm{HI+H2} - f_\mathrm{H2})\f$.

    <b>Emission</b>

    Following Draine 2011 Chapter 8, the integrated luminosity \f$L\f$ of the 21 cm line for a
    given spatial cell can be written as \f[ L = \frac{3}{4} \,A_\mathrm{SF}
    \,\frac{hc}{\lambda_\mathrm{SF}} \,n_\mathrm{HI}V \f] where \f$A_\mathrm{SF}=2.8843 \times
    10^{-15} \,s^{-1}\f$ is the Einstein coefficient of the 21cm spin-flip transition,
    \f$\lambda_\mathrm{SF} = 21.10611405413\times 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{m}\f$ is its wavelength,
    \f$n_\mathrm{HI}\f$ is the number density of atomic hydrogen in the cell, and \f$V\f$ is the
    cell volume.

    The 21cm line is extremely narrow so that the emerging line profile is dominated by the Doppler
    shift caused by the thermal motion of the atoms. The gas temperature defined in the input model
    is used to randomly shift the wavelength of each emitted photon packet according to a
    Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This happens outside of this class in the secondary source
    machinery.

    <b>Absorption</b>

    Again following Draine 2011 Chapter 8, and substituting wavelengths for frequencies, the
    monochromatic absorption cross section per neutral hydrogen atom \f$\varsigma(\lambda)\f$ at
    frequency \f$\lambda\f$ can be written as \f[\varsigma^\text{abs}(\lambda) =
    \frac{3}{32\pi}\,A_\mathrm{SF}\,\frac{hc \,\lambda_\mathrm{SF}} {k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{s}}
    \times \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{SF}} {\sqrt{2\pi}\,\sigma} \,\exp\left(-\frac{u^2(\lambda)}
    {2\sigma^2}\right) \f] where \f$T_\mathrm{s}\f$ is the spin temperature of the hydrogen gas
    (see below), \f$\sigma=\sqrt{k_B T/m_\mathrm{p}}\f$ is the velocity dispersion corresponding to
    the thermal motion of the atoms, and \f$u(\lambda)=c(\lambda-\lambda_\mathrm{SF})/\lambda\f$ is
    the frequency deviation from the line center in velocity units.

    According to Kim, Ostriker and Kim 2014 (ApJ 786:64), the spin temperature \f$T_\mathrm{s}\f$
    is essentially equal to the kinetic gas temperature \f$T\f$ for low gas temperatures
    \f$T<1000~\mathrm{K}\f$. For higher gas temperatures, it also depends on other gas properties,
    with an upper bound that never exceeds a fixed maximum value, i.e. \f$T_\mathrm{s,upper}
    \lesssim 5000~\mathrm{K}\f$ (see their Figure 2).

    To avoid the need for defining additional gas properties in the input model, we here use an
    approximate upper bound for the spin temperature given by \f[ T_\mathrm{s}= 6000~\mathrm{K}
    \times \left( 1-\mathrm{e}^{-T/5000~\mathrm{K} } \right).\f] Because the absorption cross
    section is inversely proportional to the spin temperature, this yields an approximate lower
    bound for the cross section.
