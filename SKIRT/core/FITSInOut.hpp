        planes (i.e. a 2D or 3D data array). The first argument specifies a relative or absolute

        nonempty data unit in the file; usually this is the primary data unit. To specify another
        data unit, add the extension name (EXTNAME) between square brackets after the file
        name. For example:

            SomePath/myFile.fits[SED]

        the actual values in the data cube; \em nx and \em ny receive the number of values in each
        direction, \em nz specifies the number of planes (which is equal to 1 for 2D data). The
        values in the \em data array are ordered such that the index along the x-axis varies most
        rapidly, the index along the y-axis varies less rapidly, and the index along the z-axis (if

        in the table, add the column name as follows:

            SomePath/myFile.fits[AXES][col time]

        The \em data argument serves to store the column data read from the file, and \em n

    /** This function writes a 2D data frame or a 3D data cube to the primary data unit of a FITS
        file. The x and y axes are assumed to discretize spatial extent on a regular, linear grid.
        The optional z axis often represents spectral extent and may be discretized on an arbitary
        grid. If it is present (i.e. for a 3D data cube), the function also writes the z-axis grid
        points to the FITS file as a binary table extension, so that the file is self-contained.

        The first argument specifies a relative or absolute file path; if a file with that name
        already exists, it is overwritten. The subsequent arguments specify the contents of the
        file. \em data contains the actual values in the frame or data cube; the values in this

        along the y-axis varies less rapidly, and the index along the z-axis (if present) varies
        least rapidly. \em dataUnits describes the units of the data values; \em nx and \em ny
        specify the number of values in each spatial direction, \em incx and \em incy specify the
        increment between subsequent grid points in each spatial direction, \em xc and \em yc
        specify the center of the frame(s), and \em xyUnits describes the units of the xy-grid
        increments. Finally, \em z contains the z-axis grid points (often wavelengths), and \em
        zUnits describes the units of these grid points. */
