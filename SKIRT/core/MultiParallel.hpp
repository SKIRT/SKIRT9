/** MultiParallel is an intermediate, abstract class that offers facilities for implementing
    parallel subclasses that use multiple parallel execution threads.

    Specifically, the class offers functions to create a given number of child threads and hand out
    work to them. The parent thread is never used to perform actual work, so that it remains
    available for communicating with other processes. Because the parent thread is supposed to
    consume very little resources, it is not counted towards the number of threads configured by
    the user.

    When an exception is thrown by one of the child threads, all other threads are gracefully shut
    down and a FatalError exception is thrown in the context of the parent thread. If the original
    exception was a FatalError instance, the newly thrown exception is a copy thereof. Otherwise a
    fresh FatalError instance is created with a generic error message.

    This class uses the standard low-level C++ multi-threading capabilities. It is designed to
    minimize the run-time overhead for handing out parallel tasks. Between invocations of the
    call() function, the parallel threads are put in wait so that they consume no CPU cycles (and
    very little memory). */
