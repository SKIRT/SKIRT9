/** NestedDensityTreePolicy is a tree policy that allows for nesting DensityTreePolicies, enabling
    users to define a region containing another (nested) density tree. 

    This class inherits from DensityTreePolicy and uses all the inherited properties to classify the
    outer region. Additionally, it introduces an additional property called nestedTree, which is
    also a DensityTreePolicy. The nestedTree property decides the properties of the inner region.

    If a TreeNode intersects with the inner 'nested' region the node will be subdivided based on the
    properties of the nestedTree. This means that even TreeNodes almost fully outside the inner
    region can be subdivided if they have a non-zero intersection with the inner region. */
