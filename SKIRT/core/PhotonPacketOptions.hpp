/** The PhotonPacketOptions class simply offers a number of configuration options related to the
    Monte Carlo photon packet life cycle. These options are relevant as soon as there is a medium
    in the configuration.

    Several variations of the photon life cycle implementation can be configured:

    - With or without explicit absorption. Explicit absorption allows absorption cross sections to
    be negative, which can be the case for materials that exhibit stimulated emission. Note that
    scattering cross sections never can be negative. The default behavior is not to use explicit
    absorption, because the effects of this recent technique has not yet been well studied.

    - With or without forced scattering. Forced scattering tends to reduce noise for simulations
    with low to limited optical depths, such as for most dust models on galaxy-wide scales.
    Therefore, forced scattering is the default behavior except when Lyman-alpha line transfer is
    included, because the extra peel-offs for the many resonant scattering events tend to slow down
    the simulation. Furthermore, the implementation without forced scattering currently does \em
    not support storing the radiation field, which means it cannot be used when the simulation
    includes secondary emission or dynamic state iteration.

    The remaining options serve to further configure the detailed behavior of the forced scattering
    photon cycle. */
