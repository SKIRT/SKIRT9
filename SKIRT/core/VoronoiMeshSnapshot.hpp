/** A VoronoiMeshSnapshot object represents a Voronoi tessellation or \em mesh of a cuboidal
    spatial domain (given a list of generating sites) and offers several facilities related to this
    mesh. A Voronoi mesh partitions the domain in convex polyhedra. Consider a given set of points
    in the domain, called \em sites. For each site there will be a corresponding region consisting
    of all points in the domain closer to that site than to any other. These regions are called
    Voronoi \em cells, and together they form the Voronoi tessellation of the domain.

    The VoronoiMeshSnapshot class serves two key purposes: (1) represent snapshot data produced by
    a hydrodynamical simulation and imported from a column text file, defining a primary source or
    a transfer medium distribution, and (2) implement an unstructured spatial grid that discretizes
    the spatial domain as a basis for the radiative transfer simulation itself.

    To support the first use case (imported snapshot data), the VoronoiMeshSnapshot class is based
    on the Snapshot class; it uses the facilities offered there to configure and help read the
    snapshot data, and it implements all functions in the general Snapshot public interface. In
    addition it offers functionality that is specific to this snapshot type, such as, for example,
    the requirement to configure the spatial extent of the domain. In this use case, the client
    employs the default constructor and then proceeds to configure the snapshot object as described
    in the Snapshot class header.

    To support the second use case (spatial grid for radiative transfer), the class offers
    specialty constructors that accept a list of the generating sites from various sources,
    including a programmatically generated list or a user-supplied text column file. Note that this
    input file includes just the site coordinates, while a snapshot data file would include
    additional properties for each site. The specialty constructors automatically complete the
    configuration sequence of the object, so that the getters can be used immediately after
    construction.

    Once an VoronoiMeshSnapshot object has been constructed and fully configured, its data members
    are no longer modified. Consequently all getters are re-entrant.

    Using the Voro++ library
    ------------------------

    To build the Voronoi tessellation, the buildMesh() function in this class uses the code in the
    \c voro subfolder of the SKIRT code hierarchy, which is taken from the Voro++ library written
    by Chris H. Rycroft (Harvard University/Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory) at
    https://github.com/chr1shr/voro (git commit 122531f) with minimal changes to avoid compiler
    warnings.

    A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library is that it carries out cell-based calculations,
    computing the Voronoi cell for each site individually, rather than computing the Voronoi
    tessellation as a global network of vertices and edges. It is therefore particularly
    well-suited for applications that require cell-based properties such as the cell volume, the
    centroid position or the number of faces or vertices. Equally important in the context of
    SKIRT, it is easy to distribute the work over parallel execution threads because, after setting
    up a common search data structure holding all sites, the calculations for the various cells are
    mutually independent.

    The Voro++ approach also has an important drawback. Because cells are handled independently of
    each other, floating pointing rounding errors sometimes cause inconsistencies where the results
    for one cell do not properly match the corresponding results for a neighboring cell. This most
    often happens when the generating sites are very close to each other and/or form certain
    hard-to-calculate geometries. These problems manifest themselves either as empty cells or as
    asymmetries in the neighbor lists. To handle these situations, the buildMesh() function removes
    some sites from the input list as described below.

    Firstly, before actually building the Voronoi tessellation, and in addition to removing sites
    that lie outside of the spatial domain, the function discards sites that lie closer to any
    previously listed site than \f$10^{-12}\f$ times the diagonal of the spatial domain. This
    preventative measure essentially removes any "degenerate" sites from the input list. Given the
    extremely small distances, it is very unlikely that the physcis of the input model would be
    affected by this operation.

    Secondly, after all Voronoi cells have been calculated, the function verifies the cell
    properties. If any of the cells have a zero volume or if any of the cell neighbors are not
    mutual, the involved sites are discarded and the Voronoi construction starts anew from scratch
    with the reduced list of sites. After a maximum of 5 attempts, the function throws a fatal
    error. In practice, this will hopefully never happen. Discarding incorrectly calculated cells
    perhaps incurs a slightly higher risk of changing the physcis of the input model. However, in
    practice it seems that these issues mostly occur in regions of high site density, so that the
    errors should be fairly limited. */

    //================= Construction - Destruction =================

    /** The default constructor initializes the snapshot in an invalid state; see the description
        of the required calling sequence in the Snapshot class header. */

    //========== Reading ==========

public:

        the configuration functions, stores the data for later use, and closes the file by calling
        the base class Snapshot::readAndClose() function. Sites located outside of the domain and
        sites that are too close to another site are discarded. Sites with an associated
        temperature above the cutoff temperature (if one has been configured) are assigned a
        density value of zero, so that the corresponding cell has zero mass (regardless of the
        imported mass/density properties).

        The function calls the private buildMesh() function to build the Voronoi mesh based on the
        imported site positions. If the snapshot configuration requires the ability to determine
        the density at a given spatial position, the function also calls the private buildSearch()
        function to create a data structure that accelerates locating the cell containing a given
        point.

        volume-integrated mass/number column, and (2) the snapshot will not be required to generate

        Sites located outside of the domain and sites that are too close to another site are
        discarded. The \em filename argument specifies the name of the input file, including

        objects), this private function builds the Voronoi tessellation and stores the

        interrogation capabilities offered by this class. All other data (such as Voronoi cell
        vertices, edges and faces) are discarded. In practice, the function adds the sites to a
        Voro++ container, computes the Voronoi cells one by one, and copies the relevant cell
        information (such as the list of neighboring cells) from the Voro++ data structures into
        its own.

        If the \em relax argument is true, the function performs a single relaxation step on the

        review 41.4, pp 637-676; Dobbels 2017, master thesis). An intermediate Voronoi tessellation
        is built using the original site positions, and subsequently each site position is replaced
        by the centroid (mass center) of the corresponding cell. The final tessellation is then
        constructed with these adjusted site positions, which are distributed more uniformly,
        thereby avoiding overly elongated cells in the Voronoi tessellation. Relaxation can be
        quite time-consuming because the Voronoi tessellation must be constructed twice. */

        blocks. For each block, the function builds and stores a list of all Voronoi cells that

        point in the domain then comes down to locating the block containing the point (which is
        trivial since the grid is linear). The current implementation uses a Voronoi cell's
        enclosing cuboid to test for intersection with a block. Performing a precise intersection
        test is \em really slow and the shortened block lists don't substantially accelerate the
        cellIndex() function.

        To further reduce the search time within blocks that overlap with a large number of cells,

    //====================== Path construction =====================

public:
    /** This function creates and hands over ownership of a path segment generator appropriate for
        the adaptive mesh spatial grid, implemented as a private PathSegmentGenerator subclass. The
        algorithm used to construct the path is described below.

        In the first stage, the function checks whether the start point is inside the domain. If
        so, the current point is simply initialized to the start point. If not, the function
        computes the path segment to the first intersection with one of the domain walls and moves
        the current point inside the domain. Finally the function determines the current cell, i.e.
        the cell containing the current point.

        In the second stage, the function loops over the algorithm that computes the exit point
        from the current cell, i.e. the intersection of the ray formed by the current point and
        the path direction with the current cell's boundary. By the nature of Voronoi cells, this
        algorithm also produces the ID of the neigboring cell without extra cost. If an exit point
        is found, the loop adds a segment to the output path, updates the current point and the
        current cell, and continues to the next iteration. If the exit is towards a domain wall,
        the path is complete and the loop is terminated. If no exit point is found, which shouldn't
        happen too often, this must be due to computational inaccuracies. In that case, no path
        segment is added, the current point is advanced by a small amount, and the new current cell
        is determined by calling the function whichcell().

        The algorithm that computes the exit point has the following input data:

        </TABLE>

        The line containing the ray can be written as \f$\mathcal{L}(s)=\mathbf{r}+s\,\mathbf{k}\f$
        with \f$s\in\mathbb{R}\f$. The exit point can similarly be written as
        \f$\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{r}+s_q\,\mathbf{k}\f$ with \f$s_q>0\f$, and the distance covered within
        the cell is given by \f$s_q\f$. The ID of the cell next to the exit point is denoted \f$m_q\f$
        and is easily determined as explained below.

        The algorithm that computes the exit point proceeds as follows:
         - Calculate the set of values \f$\{s_i\}\f$ for the intersection points between the line
           \f$\mathcal{L}(s)\f$ and the planes defined by the neighbors or walls \f$m_i\f$
           (see below for details on the intersection calculation).
         - Select the smallest nonnegative value \f$s_q=\min\{s_i|s_i>0\}\f$ in the set to determine
           the exit point. The neighbor or wall ID with the same index \f$i\f$ determines the
           corresponding \f$m_q\f$.
         - If there is no nonnegative value in the set, no exit point has been found.

        To calculate \f$s_i\f$ for a regular neighbor \f$m_i\geq 0\f$, intersect the
        line \f$\mathcal{L}(s)=\mathbf{r}+s\,\mathbf{k}\f$ with the plane bisecting the points
        \f$\mathbf{p}(m_i)\f$ and \f$\mathbf{p}(m_r)\f$. An unnormalized vector perpendicular to
        this plane is given by \f[\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{p}(m_i)-\mathbf{p}(m_r)\f]
        and a point on the plane is given by
        \f[\mathbf{p}=\frac{\mathbf{p}(m_i)+\mathbf{p}(m_r)}{2}.\f] The equation
        of the plane can then be written as \f[\mathbf{n}\cdot(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{p})=0.\f]
        Substituting \f$\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{r}+s_i\,\mathbf{k}\f$ and solving for \f$s_i\f$ provides
        \f[s_i=\frac{\mathbf{n}\cdot(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{r})}{\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{k}}.\f]
        If \f$\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{k}=0\f$ the line and the plane are parallel and there
        is no intersection. In that case no \f$s_i\f$ is added to the set of candidate
        exit points.

        To calculate \f$s_i\f$ for a wall \f$m_i<0\f$, substitute the appropriate normal and
        position vectors for the wall plane in this last formula. For example, for the left wall
        with \f$m_i=-1\f$ one has \f$\mathbf{n}=(-1,0,0)\f$ and \f$\mathbf{p}=(x_\text{min},0,0)\f$
        so that \f[s_i=\frac{x_\text{min}-r_x}{k_x}.\f]
