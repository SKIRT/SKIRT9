/** TetraMeshSpatialGrid is a concrete subclass of SpatialGrid representing a 3D tetrahedral mesh
    generated from a set of vertices. The resulting grid fully covers the domain by including the
    8 corners of the domain as vertices. Since a tetrahedral mesh always fills the convex hull of
    the vertices, the domain is always fully covered. This grid will thus always have at least 8
    vertices. The grid is constructed using the open-source library TetGen version 1.6.0 (released
    on August 31, 2020). TetGen is an advanced C++ tetrahedral mesh generator with many features.
    This class uses the following key features of TetGen:

    - Delaunay Tetrahedralization:
      Generate a unique Delaunay tetrahedral mesh from a given set of vertices.

    - %Mesh Refinement:
      Refine the tetrahedral mesh using TetGen's Delaunay refinement algorithm. This option
      is enabled through the \em refine property of this class.

    It should be noted that TetGen is a single-threaded library, but the algorithms used are
    generally quite fast. The refinement process is by far the most time-consuming part of the
    mesh generation.

    The 3D Delaunay tetrahedralization often contains cells less suited for a computational grid.
    While the 2D Delaunay triangulation maximizes the smallest angle in each triangle, resulting
    in more regular cells, the 3D version lacks this property. Consequently, 3D tetrahedralizations
    frequently contain elongated, irregular cells. To address this, Delaunay refinement algorithms
    can be used. TetGen implements its own refinement process, applying local mesh operations like
    vertex smoothing, edge and face swapping, edge contraction, and vertex insertion. This
    refinement aims to optimize quality metrics such as the radius-edge ratio and the minimum
    dihedral angle. All refinement parameters are kept at their default values provided by TetGen.
    However, it is uncertain whether this refinement process will greatly improve the grids for
    radiative transfer applications.

    The positions of the vertices used for generating the tetrahedral mesh are determined by the
    \em policy property. The available policies are:

    - Uniform: Randomly sampled from a uniform distribution.
    - CentralPeak: Randomly sampled from a distribution with a steep central peak.
    - DustDensity: Randomly sampled based on the dust density distribution.
    - ElectronDensity: Randomly sampled based on the electron density distribution.
    - GasDensity: Randomly sampled based on the gas density distribution.
    - File: Loaded from a column data file specified by the \em filename property,
            containing vertex coordinates (x, y, z) in each column.

    Vertices are removed if they lie outside the simulation domain or are too close to another.

    //===================== Path construction =====================

public:
    /** This function creates and returns ownership of a path segment generator suitable for the
        tetrahedral spatial grid, implemented as a private \em PathSegmentGenerator subclass. The
        algorithm for constructing the path is taken from Maria et al. (2017).

        The algorithm uses PlÃ¼cker coordinates to identify the exit face of a ray inside a given
        tetrahedron. PlÃ¼cker coordinates are a set of six values that describe a directed line in 3D space:
        \f[\mathbf{\pi}_R = \{\mathbf{k} : \mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{r}\} = \{\mathbf{U}_R : \mathbf{V}_R\}\f]
        where \f$\mathbf{r}\f$ is a position along the ray, and \f$\mathbf{k}\f$ is the ray's direction.
        The PlÃ¼cker product is defined as:
        \f[\mathbf{\pi}_R \odot \mathbf{\pi}_S = \mathbf{U}_R \cdot \mathbf{V}_S + \mathbf{U}_S \cdot \mathbf{V}_R\f]
        This product determines the relative orientation between two rays:
        \f[\mathbf{\pi}_R \odot \mathbf{\pi}_S = \begin{cases}
        > 0 & \iff S \text{ goes counterclockwise around } R\\
        < 0 & \iff S \text{ goes clockwise around } R\\
        = 0 & \iff S \text{ intersects or is parallel to } R \end{cases} \f]
        A ray exits a tetrahedron through a particular face if the PlÃ¼cker products with all three
        clockwise-ordered edges of that face are negative. The algorithm in Maria et al. (2017) optimizes
        this by requiring only two PlÃ¼cker products to be evaluated. Our implementation is described below.

        In the first step, the function checks whether the start point is inside the domain. If so, the current
        point is simply initialized to the start point. If not, the function computes the path segment to the
        first intersection with one of the domain walls and moves the current point inside the domain. Next,
        the function determines the cell index of the tetrahedron containing the current point. If none is
        found, the path is terminated. Before the traversal algorithm can commence, a non-leaving face must
        be identified. This face acts as the entry face for the ray. Note that this face does not necessarily
        have to be the actual entry face. This task is handled by the \em findEnteringFace function of the
        \em Tetra class.

        Next, the traversal algorithm begins. The entering face is labeled as face 0, with its opposing vertex
        labeled as vertex 0. We start by evaluating the PlÃ¼cker product of the ray with the edge \f$1 \to 0\f$.
        Based on whether this product is positive or negative, the next PlÃ¼cker product to evaluate is determined.
        If the product is negative (i.e., clockwise orientation), we evaluate the product with the edge in the
        clockwise direction viewed from vertex 0. The same applies for a positive product. The exit face is
        determined using the decision tree described in Maria et al. (2017). The distance traveled through the
        cell is calculated using a simple line-plane intersection:
        \f[s_i = \frac{\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{r})}{\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{k}}\f]
        where \f$\mathbf{n}\f$ is the outward-pointing normal of the face, \f$\mathbf{v}\f$ is any vertex on
        the exit face, and \f$\mathbf{r}\f$ is the current position.

        Although the algorithm described in Maria et al. (2017) works even if one of the PlÃ¼cker products is zero,
        we revert to a plane intersection algorithm in such cases. This approach is similar to the one used in the
        \em VoronoiMeshSnapshot class, where the closest intersection distance with all faces is found.

        The algorithm continues until the exit face lies on the convex hull boundary. At this point, the path is
        terminated. If the exit face is not found, which should only rarely happen due to computational
        inaccuracies, the current point is advanced by a small distance, and the cell index is recalculated. */
