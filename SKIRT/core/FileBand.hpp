/** A FileBand object represents a wavelength band with a transmission curve that is loaded from an
    input file. The floating point numbers in the first two columns of the text file specify
    respectively the wavelength and the corresponding transmission value. Any additional columns in
    the file are ignored. The transmission outside the range indicated by the first and the last
    wavelength in the list is considered to be zero.

    The wavelengths are by default given in micron (the units can be overridden by column header
    info in the file) and must listed be in increasing order. The transmission values are
    dimensionless. The scaling of these values is arbitrary because the transmission curve will be
    normalized after being loaded. Refer to the description of the Band class for more information.
