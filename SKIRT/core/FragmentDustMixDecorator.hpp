/** A FragmentDustMixDecorator instance aggregates a fixed number of predefined dust populations,
    called \em fragments, and provides a way to manage the relative weight of each of those
    fragments during the simulation. The aggregated fragments are defined by specifying a
    MultiGrainDustMix instance as part of the user configuration. Depending on a user configuration
    flag, the specified multi-grain dust mix is fragmented into its underlying dust populations or
    into the individual grain size bins for those populations. A fragment dust mix decorator thus
    essentially splits a multi-grain dust mix into its underlying fragments. The dust mix being
    fragmented can be a turn-key multi-grain mix (e.g., ZubkoDustMix) or a fully user-configured
    dust mix (ConfigurableDustMix), offering nearly limitless possibilities.

    The specific medium state for a fragmented dust mix consists of a weight factor for each
    fragment. To construct the aggregated dust mix represented by the fragmented dust mix for a
    given spatial cell, the dust mass represented by each fragment in the original dust mix is
    multiplied by its corresponding weight factor in the specific state. In other words, a weight
    factor of one means that the fragment's mass remains unchanged from the original dust mix.

    Initialization of the specific medium state proceeds as follows. If the fragmented dust mix is
    configured as part of a geometric medium component, all fragment weight factors are set to a
    value of one, thus preserving the relative weigths of the fragments in the original dust mix.
    If the fragmented dust mix is configured as part of an imported medium component, the fragment
    weight factors are imported from the snapshot.

    FragmentDustMixDecorator inherits directly from MaterialMix rather than from DustMix or
    MultiGrainDustMix so that it cannot be nested inside another fragment dust mix decorator or
    inside a SelectDustMixFamily instance. */
