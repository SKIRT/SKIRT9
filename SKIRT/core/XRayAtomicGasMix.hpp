/** The XRayAtomicGasMix class describes the material properties of neutral atomic gas in the X-ray
    wavelength range, taking into account the effects of photo-absorption, fluorescence, and
    scattering by bound electrons. This material mix should not be used for wavelengths outside of
    the X-ray regime for which it has been designed. Specifically, several of the assumptions and
    numerical treatments break down for photon energies below 4 eV.

    The class assumes a gas containing a mixture of non-ionized elements with atomic numbers from 1
    (hydrogen) up to 30 (zinc). The spatial density distribution of the gas is established by
    setting the hydrogen density. The relative abundances of the 30 elements and the temperature of
    the gas can be configured by the user as constant properties. In other words, the abundances
    and the temperature are considered to be spatially constant (for a given medium component),
    while the overall density can obviously vary across space as usual.

    Photo-absorption by an atom is the process where the energy of a photon is used to liberate a
    bound electron from one of the electron shells of the atom. This class supports
    photo-absorption by any of the 30 elements in the gas for any of the electron shells, i.e. up
    to the K, L, M, or N shell depending on the atomic number of the element.

    Fluorescence (in this context) is the process where an electron from a higher energy level
    "falls" into an empty space created by photo-absorption, emitting a new photon with a different
    energy. For each electron shell and for each possible fluorescence transition towards that
    shell, the \em yield defines the probability that such fluorescence event occurs after an
    electron has been liberated in that shell. This class supports K\f$\alpha\f$ and K\f$\beta\f$
    fluorescence (transitions from higher shells towards the K shell) for all elements in the gas.

    Because fluorescence only occurs as the result of a photo-absorption event, this class
    implements fluorescence as a form of scattering (where the wavelength of the photon being
    scattered changes) as opposed to emission. This allows both photo-absorption and fluorescence
    to be treated during primary emission. A possible drawback is that the weaker fluorescence
    lines will be represented by a fairly small number of photon packets.

    Electrons bound to the atoms in the gas scatter incoming X-ray photons with a cross section
    that is very close to that of free electrons. For lower X-ray photon energies, the phase
    function for the two processes differs substantially. However, in that regime, scattering is
    totally dominated by photo-absorption, so it does not seem important to accurately model the
    scattering process. For higher X-ray photon energies, where the scattering cross section does
    become significant, bound-electron scattering closely approaches free-electron scattering. This
    class thus simply assumes that each of the electrons bound to the atoms in the gas
    Compton-scatters the incoming photons (for more information, see the ComptonPhaseFunction
    class). Because the gas is assumed to be neutral, the number of electrons is equal to the
    number of protons, which is easily obtained from the atomic numbers and the respective
    abundances.

    <b>Configuring the simulation</b>

    In addition to a medium component configured with the material mix represented by this class,
    simulations will usually include primary sources and possibly a dust medium. As indicated
    above, there is no need to include secondary emission, so the simulation mode can be set to
    "ExtinctionOnly" and there is no need to store the radiation field. The resulting continuum
    spectrum and absorption and emission features can be recorded by a single instrument configured
    with a high-resolution wavelength grid, or separate instruments can be configured with
    wavelength grids to resolve specific features of interest.

    To study fluorescence lines seperated from the background continuum, configure the instrument
    to record flux components seperately and consider the scattered flux component, which includes
    the fluorescence lines in addition to any flux scattered from other media components. To ensure
    that low-intensity lines are properly included in this flux, set the advanced property \em
    minWeightReduction in the \c PhotonPacketOptions section to a value of \c 1e10 or so. With the
    default value of \c 1e4, low-intensity fluorescence photon packets are killed before having a
    chance to register in the instruments.

    The input model must define the spatial distribution of the hydrogen number density
    \f$n_\mathrm{H} = n_\mathrm{HI} + n_\mathrm{HII} + 2\,n_\mathrm{H2}\f$, i.e. including atomic,
    ionized, and molecular hydrogen. Note the factor 2 in this equation; \f$n_\mathrm{H}\f$ in fact
    specifies the number of hydrogen protons per volume rather than the number of hydrogen-like
    particles per volume.

    If this material mix is associated with a geometric medium component, the geometry defines the
    spatial density distribution \f$n_\mathrm{H}\f$. Alternatively, if the material mix is
    associated with a subclass of ImportedMedium, the spatial density distribution is read from an
    input file. In that case, the ski file attributes \em importMetallicity, \em importTemperature,
    and \em importVariableMixParams must be left at 'false'. For example, if bulk velocities are
    also imported for this medium component (i.e. \em importVelocity is 'true'), the column order
    would be \f[ ..., n_\mathrm{H}, v_\mathrm{x}, v_\mathrm{y}, v_\mathrm{z} \f]

    The relative abundances of the 30 elements in the gas and the temperature of the gas are
    configured in the ski file as constant properties. In other words, the abundances and the
    temperature are considered to be spatially constant (for a given medium component). If the list
    of abundances is left empty in the ski file, default abundancies are used, taken from Table 2
    of Anders & Grevesse (1989), the default abundance table in Xspec. In the default list, the
    abundance of hydrogen is set to unity. However, it is acceptable to specify a hydrogen
    abundance lower than one, for example to model an ionized hydrogen fraction.

    <b>Photo-absorption cross section</b>

    The total photo-absorption cross section per hydrogen atom for this material mix is obtained by
    accumulating the photo-absorption cross sections for all shells and for all individual
    elements, weighted by element abundancy, and convolved with a Gaussian profile reflecting each
    element's thermal velocity. Because the abundancies and the temperature are fixed, this
    calculation can be performed during setup and the result stored, discretized on a
    high-resolution wavelength grid for later retrieval.

    Verner and Yakovlev (1995) provide analytic fits to the photo-absorption cross sections
    \f$\sigma_{ph}(E)\f$ as a function of photon energy \f$E\f$ for the ground-state shells of the
    first 30 atomic elements:

    \f[\begin{aligned} \sigma_{ph}(E) &= \begin{cases} 0 & E < E_\mathrm{th} \\ \sigma_0 \,
    F(E/E_0) & E \ge E_\mathrm{th} \end{cases}, \\ F(y) &= \left[(y-1)^2+y_{\rm w}^2 \right]y^{-Q}
    \left(1+ \sqrt{(y/y_{\rm a})} \right )^{-P}, \\ Q&=5.5+l-0.5P, \end{aligned} \f]

    with \f$E_\mathrm{th}\f$ the tabulated ionization threshold energy, \f$\sigma_0\f$, \f$E_0\f$,
    \f$y_{\rm w}\f$, \f$y_{\rm a}\f$ and \f$P\f$ five tabulated fitting parameters, and \f$l\f$ the
    subshell orbital quantum number (\f$l=0, 1, 2, 3\f$ for s, p, d, f orbitals respectively).

    <b>Fluorescence cross section</b>

    The total fluorescence cross section per hydrogen atom for this material mix is obtained
    similarly, but now including only the K shell photo-absorption cross section for each element
    and multiplying by the appropriate fluorescence yields in addition to element abundancy.

    <b>Electron scattering cross section</b>

    As described above, this class assumes that the electrons bound to the atoms in the gas scatter
    photon in the same way as free electrons would. The corresponding cross section per hydrogen
    atom for the complete material mix is then easily obtained as \f$\sum_{Z=1}^30 Z\,a_Z\f$, where
    \f$Z\f$ is the atomic number and \f$a_Z\f$ is the abundance of the corresponding element
    relative to hydrogen.

    <b>Performing scattering</b>

    The function performing an actual scattering event randomly selects one of the supported
    scattering channels (i.e. scattering by an electron bound to one of the supported elements or a
    K\f$\alpha\f$ or K\f$\beta\f$ fluorescence transition for one of the supported elements). The
    relative probabilities for these transitions as a function of incoming photon packet wavelength
    are also calculated during setup. The selected transition determines the scattering mechanism.
    For bound electrons, Compton scattering is used. For fluorescence, the emission direction is
    isotropic, and the outgoing wavelength is the fluorescence wavelength. In both cases, a random
    Gaussian dispersion reflecting the interacting element's thermal velocity is applied to the
    outgoing wavelength.

    <b>Thermal dispersion</b>

    The thermal dispersion appropriate for a given interaction depends on the (constant)
    temperature configured for this material mix and on the mass of the interacting atom. For
    electron scattering and fluorescence events, the implementation is straightforward. Once a
    channel has been randomly selected, the magnitude of the interacting atom's thermal velocity is
    taken from a precalculated table and a velocity vector is sampled from the Maxwell
    distribution.

    For absorption, the situation is much more involved. In principle, the full cross section curve
    for each ionization transition must be convolved with a Gaussian kernel of appropriate width.
    In practice, the cross section curves are very smooth except for the step at the threshold
    energy. The effect of the convolution is therefore limited to energies near the threshold
    energy, replacing the infinitely steep step by a sigmoid function. Considering that the
    convolution of a step function with a Gaussion is given by the error function, this class uses
    the following approximation. With \f$E_\mathrm{th}\f$ the threshold energy and
    \f$E_\mathrm{s}\f$ the energy dispersion corresponding to the thermal velocity of the atom
    being ionized, the cross section near \f$E_\mathrm{th}\f$ is replaced by

    \f[ \sigma_{ph}'(E) = \frac{\sigma_{ph}(E_\mathrm{th} +2 E_\mathrm{s})} {2} \, \left[ 1+
    \mathrm{erf} ( \frac{E - E_\mathrm{th}} {E_\mathrm{s}} ) \right] \qquad \mathrm{for} \;
    E_\mathrm{th} -2 E_\mathrm{s} < E < E_\mathrm{th} +2 E_\mathrm{s}. \f]

    The sigmoid is scaled by the value of the actual cross section at the end of the interval,
    achieving good continuity at that point in most cases, including all important transitions.
