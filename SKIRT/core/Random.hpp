/** The Random class offers pseudo-random number generation facilities in a multi-threaded
    environment. At the core of its operation is the function to generate a uniform deviate, i.e. a
    pseudo-random number drawn from the uniform probability distribution over the unit interval.
    Additional functions allow drawing pseudo-random numbers from other frequently-used probability
    distributions.

    To avoid the need for synchronization between multiple execution threads, each thread receives
    its own thread-local pseudo-random number generator instance. The parent thread in each process
    (i.e. the thread that calls the setup() function) receives a \em predictable generator. This
    generator is initialized with a fixed state depending only on the value of the
    user-configurable \em seed property, so that it delivers exactly the same pseudo-random
    sequence for every parent thread in every process and for every execution of the program. All
    other (child) threads receive an \em arbitrary generator. These generators are seeded with a
    truly random state obtained from the operating system, so that they deliver a unique and
    unpredictable pseudo-random sequence for each thread, and for each execution of the program.

    This mechanism is intended to support the following use cases. In single thread/single process
    mode, repeated execution (with the same \em seed value) must produce identical results. This is
    important, for example, for automated testing. The user can force a different randomization by
    specifying another \em seed value. In multi-threading and/or multi-processing mode, for tasks
    employing parallelization, each of the threads in each of the processes requires a different
    random sequence. On the other hand, in this mode, for serialized tasks, the (single) thread
    employed in each of the processes must receive the same random sequence. This is important for
    functions that rely on randomness but need to produce the same result in every parallel
    process.

    The recommended use of the Random class is to include a single instance in each simulation
    run-time hierarchy. The use cases discussed above can be achieved as follows. In single
    thread/single process mode, perform all tasks in the parent thread. In multi-threading and/or
    multi-processing mode, perform serial tasks in the parent thread of each process, and perform
    all parallized tasks in a child thread.

    As an additional service, this class allows temporarily installing a predictable random number
    generator with a given seed in the current execution thread through the push() and pop()
    functions. This supports the use case where, usually during setup, the same pseudo-random
    sequence is required in multiple places.

    All random number generators used in this class are based on the 64-bit Mersenne twister, which
    offers a sufficiently long period and acceptable spectral properties for most purposes. */

        the pdf is linear in log-log space between any two grid points (equivalent to power-law
        behavior), as described below.

        Consider the pdf values \f$p_i\f$ and \f$p_{i+1}\f$ at two consecutive grid points
        \f$x_i\f$ and \f$x_{i+1}\f$. Assuming power-law behavior, the pdf between these two grid

        p_i x_i \;\mathrm{gln}\left(-\alpha_i, \frac{x}{x_i}\right) \f] which leads to

        generalized exponential, defined in the description of respectively the
