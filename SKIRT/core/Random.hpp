/** The Random class offers pseudo-random number generation facilities in a multi-threaded
    environment. At the core of its operation is the function to generate a uniform deviate, i.e. a
    pseudo-random number drawn from the uniform probability distribution over the unit interval.
    Additional functions allow drawing pseudo-random numbers from other frequently-used probability
    distributions.

    To avoid the need for synchronization between multiple execution threads, each thread receives
    its own pseudo-random number generator instance. In fact, for each execution thread in the
    process, the class constructs two thread-local pseudo-random number generators. The \em
    arbitrary generator is seeded with a truly random state obtained from the operating system, so
    that it delivers a unique and unpredictable pseudo-random sequence for each thread, and for
    each execution of the program. The \em predictable generator is always initialized with the
    same fixed state (depending on the value of the user-configurable \em seed property), so that
    it delivers exactly the same pseudo-random sequence for every thread and for every execution of
    the program.

    At any one time, a particular thread in the process uses one of these two generators. Most
    threads employ the arbitrary generator at all times. As an exception, the \em parent thread of
    a Random instance (i.e. the thread that called its setup() function) may sometimes use the
    predictable generator. Specifically, the Random::setupSelfBefore() function (re-)initializes
    the predictable random generator to its fixed initial state (depending on the value of the
    user-configurable \em seed property), and causes the calling thread (i.e., its parent thread)
    to use the predictable generator. The Random::switchToArbitrary() and
    Random::switchToPredictable() functions can be used to switch the parent thread between both
    generators.

    This complicated mechanism is intended to support the following use cases:
      - Repeated execution in single thread/single process mode (with the same \em seed value)
        must produce identical results. This is important, for example, for automated testing.
      - The user can force a different randomization, even in single thread/single process mode,
        by specifying another \em seed value.
      - With parallel threads, tasks are performed in unpredictable order and thus the random
        sequence is interrogated in an unpredictable order; the sequence can just as well be
        unpredictable to begin with.
      - When distributing tasks over multiple processes, each of the threads requires a different
        random sequence.
      - When duplicating tasks in multiple processes, each of the processes must produce an
        identical result (using a single thread in each process) and thus those threads require
        the same random sequence.

    The recommended use of the Random class is to include a single instance in each simulation
    run-time hierarchy. The Parallel subclasses returned from a ParallelFactory in the same
    run-time hierarchy will then call the switchToArbitrary() and switchToPredictable() functions
    at the appropriate times.

    All rng's used in this class are based on the 64-bit Mersenne twister, which offers a
    sufficiently long period and acceptable spectral properties for most purposes. */

        the pdf is linear in log-log space between any two grid points (equivalent to power-law
        behavior), as described below.

        Consider the pdf values \f$p_i\f$ and \f$p_{i+1}\f$ at two consecutive grid points
        \f$x_i\f$ and \f$x_{i+1}\f$. Assuming power-law behavior, the pdf between these two grid

        SpecialFunctions::gln() and SpecialFunctions::gexp() functions. */
