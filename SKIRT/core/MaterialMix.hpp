/** MaterialMix is the abstract base class for all classes representing the concrete material
    properties of a specific transfer medium. The MaterialMix class hierarchy allows fundamentally
    different material types (e.g. dust, electrons, and hydrogen-dominated gas) to be implemented
    as part of a single framework.

    Instances of MaterialMix subclasses are immutable after setup has been completed, so the same
    instance can be reused in multiple contexts.

    <b>Material properties</b>

    The medium state maintained by a simulation for each cell and medium component includes a
    pointer to a MaterialMix instance defining the properties of the material, and a number density
    value defining the amount of material present in the cell per unit of volume. The kind of
    physical entity being counted by the number density and the conversion from number density to
    mass density depend on the type of material, as indicated in the table below.

    Material type | Entity counted | Mass conversion
    --------------|----------------|-----------------------------
    Dust          | hydrogen atom  | dust mass per hydrogen atom
    Electrons     | electron       | electron mass
    Gas           | hydrogen atom  | gas mass per hydrogen atom

    The following table lists some relevant physical quantities including cell properties that may
    be traced by a simulation, material properties defined by material mixes, and properties that
    can be derived from these.

    <b>Public interface</b>

    All MaterialMix subclasses, regardless of material type, must implement the public interface
    offered by this base class. This interface includes the capabilities required for tracing
    photon packets through a material of this type, in other words, for processing absorption and
    scattering.

    When the implementation of a particular feature specific to a subset of material mixes requires
    external access to information offered by those material mixes, the corresponding set of public
    functions is bundled in a separate abstract interface that can be implemented in the
    appropriate subclasses.

    <b>Capabilities functions</b>

    The MaterialMix class hierarchy offers the materialType() function to obtain the overall
    material category (dust, gas, or electrons). In addition, it offers a number of Boolean
    functions that indicate whether a certain physical process is supported.

    This approach allows fine-grained run-time discovery of capabilities. The functions can be
    used, for example, during setup to ensure that the configuration is valid (e.g., all material
    mixes have the same level of support for polarization, all material mixes support stochastic
    heating when enabled in the configuration), to disable optimizations as needed (e.g., when
    calculating optical depth for dichroic materials), and to enable probing of the appropriate
    information (e.g., grain size distributions only for dust mixes offering that information).

    <b>Medium state setup functions</b>

    The MaterialMix class hierarchy offers a number of functions that advertise the required medium
    state variables and assist with initializing their values during setup. For example, the
    specificStateVariableInfo() function returns a list of medium state variable descriptors
    specifying the specific state variables used by the material mix. This allows the medium system
    to allocate storage for the appropriate set of state variables.

    All common state variables and the number density (part of the specific state) are initialized
    by the medium system. Additional specific state variables must be initialized in the
    initializeSpecificState() material mix function, which is invoked by the medium system for each
    spatial cell just after the common state variables and the number density have been
    initialized. If the material mix is configured as part of an imported medium component, extra
    data fields imported from the snapshot based on the information returned by the parameterInfo()
    function is passed to this function.

    <b>Low-level material properties functions</b>

    The MaterialMix class hierarchy offers functions for retrieving some basic material properties
    as a function of wavelength, including the absorption cross section, the scattering cross
    section, and the scattering asymmetry parameter. These functions return \em default property
    values, assuming fixed, predefined values for any quantities other than wavelength (e.g., a
    default temperature, no polarization, no kinematics).

    In principle, the values returned by these low-level functions may be used only during setup
    and for probing. However, some portions of the photon life cycle code might be optimized to use
    these functions directly in cases where the optical properties are known to depend solely on
    the photon packet’s wavelength.

    <b>High-level functions for photon life cycle</b>

    Most importantly, the MaterialMix class hierarchy offers a set of functions that help implement
    the photon life cycle on a high, generic level. These functions  receive at least two
    arguments: an object representing the medium state for a spatial cell and for a medium
    component configured with the receiving material mix, and an incoming photon packet. Extra
    arguments may override information that is also available as part of the state or photon
    packet, or they may simply provide additional information.

    For example, the opacityAbs() and opacitySca() functions return the absorption and scattering
    opacity \f$k=n\varsigma\f$. They are given a wavelength that overrides the photon packet
    wavelength. Providing a photon packet is in fact optional so that these functions can be used
    in situations where there is no photon packet involved, such as when calculating the luminosity
    absorbed by the dust in a cell.

    The propagate() function adjusts the photon packet for any effects caused by propagation over a
    given distance through the cell. This may include, for example, changes to the polarization
    state caused by dichroism. The function also returns the total (possibly dichroic) optical
    depth for the photon packet intensity over the given distance.

    The performScattering() function handles a complete random-walk scattering interaction with the
    medium component of the receiving material mix, including the effects of bulk velocity,
    polarization, and so forth. The peelOffScattering() function similarly calculates the
    contribution to a scattering peel-off event for this material, given the instrument reference
    frame and the relative weight of this medium component.

    <b>Functions for secondary emission</b>

    These functions receive the radiation field in a given cell as one of their arguments.

    The emissivity() function returns the emissivity spectrum per material entity of the material
    mix when it would be embedded in a given radiation field, assuming default values for any
    specific state variables and assuming isotropic, unpolarized emission. For regular dust mixes
    that don't vary spatially and that represent spherical grains, the emissivity tells the full
    story. For other material mixes, it provides just a default (or is not present at all).

    The emissionSpectrum() function returns the emission spectrum in the spatial cell and medium
    component represented by the specified material state and the receiving material mix when it
    would be embedded in the specified radiation field. The returned spectrum takes into account
    the values of any relevant specific or common state variables, including the number density of
    the material in the specified cell.

    The indicativeTemperature() function returns an indicative temperature with an interpretation
    depending on the material type. For dust mixes it returns the averaged equilibrium temperature
    of the grain population given the specified radiation field and assuming local thermal
    equilibrium conditions. Other materials may return a temperature determined based on the
    radiation field, the specific state, a default value, or zero if none of the above apply.

    <b>Functions for spheroidal grains</b>

    These functions provide additional optical properties intended for use with the
    SpheroidalPolarization mode. Over time, the design of this part of the interface should be
    evaluated and possibly reconsidered. */
